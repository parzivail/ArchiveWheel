	"description": [
	  "Enter the realm of a retired assassin, forced back into action by treason. You may be a hired killer but you still have a sense of loyalty and justice. Visit the dark recesses of a world corrupted by crime, greed, degradation and dishonor. And a past that catches up with you. Trust no one. If the price is right, the finger of your most trusted ally will be on the trigger.\n\nVisit the dark recesses of a world corrupted by crime, greed, degradation and dishonor. Your targets may hide in the most remote areas of the planet, but their destruction is never prevented - only postponed. Master the tools of your trade and remember: rash decisions bleed consequences. Know when to strike instantly, know when to take your time. Chance favors the prepared player. Failure is not an option, it is a privilege reserved for those who do not try hard enough. You have returned, and you will track down the organization that forced you out of retirement. You may find that the enemy is closer than you think."
