	  "\"Worms is a strategy game with a difference it appeals to the dark side of human nature. Basically you control your four worms and are at war with up to 3 other teams. You must try and use the weapons at your disposal in the best possible way - or at least to the most devastating effect.\n\nLots of people will emerge with countless different strategies, but the basic strategy is that you must protect your worms whilst causing as much pain to the other team(s) as possible.\n\nWorms also differs in that it doesn't take long before people start feeling very close to their little pink chums - you start to feel for them as they are blown away and you very soon start to exact revenge on rival teams at any attempt to kill your beloved team.\n\nWorms is a game that you simply must play - the PC has been party to many visually stunning, yet unsatisfying genres over the last 2 or 3 years. Here is a game that reeks of gameplay - we hope that you`ll spend a little time getting to know it and that by the time the much more enhanced and option laden full game comes out, that you`ll be absolutely itching for more.\n\nWorms. How hard is your worm? \""
