	  "Geneforge 3 is the next, huge installment of the Geneforge saga. In this fantasy adventure, you can explore strange, hostile lands, choose which side you will fight for, and, as always, make your own horde of completely obedient mutant monsters.\n\nYou have been chosen. You are one of the precious few who will be allowed to become a Shaper. You will be given the power to create life and mold it to serve your own needs. The whole world fears and respects the Shapers. Your secrets are many, and your power is absolute.\n\nBut then, the disaster happened. Your school was attacked and destroyed. Rebels and monsters begin roaming the lands, challenging the rule of the Shapers, bringing fire and destruction with them. On your own, in a foreign land, you will have to attain power, find allies, and discover a way to defeat the rebels.\n\nOr perhaps, you will join the rebels instead. Because, for some reason, they seem very eager to recruit you ...\n\nGeneforge 3 has a huge and open storyline. You can help one of several factions, each with its own goals. There are dozens of different endings. You can help the rebels, or fight them. Slay your enemies, or use stealth and diplomacy. When you finish the game, start over, choose a different side or tactics, and experience a completely different game. No matter what you choose, Geneforge 3 offers an enormous adventure with plenty of replay value."
