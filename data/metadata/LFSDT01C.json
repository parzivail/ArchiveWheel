(Answer: Sophisticated and competitive racing - or just for fun)<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Live for Speed is a small development team dedicated to making the best online racing simulator. We currently have two versions available, Live for Speed Demo and Live for Speed S1 with which we attempt to recreate the thrill and fun of real racing, by simulating all aspects important to racing. Varying racing environments and cars which can be setup by an abundance of options - all on your home pc.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>So what will you find in LFS S1? The DEMO contains 3 cars and one racing environment that has both a road and rallycross course, available in both directions. The cars available are a front wheel drive hatchback, and one rear wheel drive car which is also available in a turbo version. The FULL version, adds two more racing environments, a big test area and 5 more cars - The test area contains many configurations; a skidpad and an autocross area, including an editor to create your own autocross tracks.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>There is a lot of community activity. Our forum has become the centre of communication for the community and has become a huge resource of information, help and additional downloads for the game. But it doesn't stop at our forum, localised communities have sprung up all over the world. Leagues are being run on nearly every continent, varying from endurance up to sprint races. All your actions online are recorded on the website and for the offline side we have the hotlap charts.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Do you want to try LFS S1? You can download the DEMO which, is available free to everyone, and has no time limits or restrictions to the game itself, but does not have all the contents of the FULL version. The FULL version can be unlocked when you have purchased an S1 license via our site.\u00a0<\/div><\/div>"
