	  "<div>Many soccer games can be difficult to play on a PC, so Sensible Software has attempted, by concentrating on playability, to create a soccer game that you can play on your PC while maintaining a strong sense of realism. You can play in seven stadiums, listen to more than 50 different crowd chants and yells, coach players individually or as a group, assign free kicks and corner kicks to the player of your choice, and alter your tactics from the bench at any point during the game. Sensible Soccer 98 includes 160 national teams, and you can create up to 64 customized teams populated with the players of your choice.<\/div>"
