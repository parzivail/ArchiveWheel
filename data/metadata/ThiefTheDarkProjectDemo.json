	  "Success requires more than firepower - use stealth and intellect to outwit your enemies. \n\nUnique weapons help you achieve your goals: Use your Blackjack to knockout unsuspecting opponents, a noise arrow to throw them off the trail, moss bombs to silence your footsteps in stone corridors, and if these don't keep you out of sight, it might be time to resort to more drastic measures, like a fire arrow, or your trusty sword. \n\nThe revolutionary \"Dark Engine\" TM provides advanced environmental simulation never before achieved in a PC game. \n\nAdvanced AI includes creatures with \"hearing\" capabilities, which react to sounds in the environment - so step lightly across the stones and look for carpeted areas to sneak past enemies. \n\nImprovise tactics in a fluid, ever-changing game world, without the restrictions of conventional game engines. \n\nProvides realistic simulation of fire, water, wind and their effects in the game environment: flammable objects catch fire, buoyant objects float, heavy objects can be used to block doors. \n\nAdvanced graphics engine with multiple texture resolutions, dynamic lighting."
