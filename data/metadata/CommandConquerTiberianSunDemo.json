	  "It's the year 2015, and a dark time for humanity. The original Economic boom that was Tiberium, has turned into a Night-mare for Humanity. With Tiberium over-running the World, GDI has evacuated all who would come to the South Pole, where Tiberium growth is slowed. They Co-ordinate their troops there, from an orbiting Space Station called 'The Philadelphia. The Brotherhood of Nod is divided into many small factions. Kane's return has turned most of the factions to his side, but the Most powerful, led by Hassan, still stands against him. The Heretics shall pay... Before his dis-appearance in 1995, Kane began the creation of Tiberium Mutants, who he believed to be the next step in our Evolution. His first batch failed Horribly and were cast out. Now called the Forgotten, these Mutants have created a Resistance to Nod. While they do not wholly Trust GDI, they are willing to help out, as long as they are convinced. Meanwhile, a mysterious alien race called The Scrinn overlook... A proverb comes to mind 'The Crow delights to see the Grasshoppers fight amongst themselves."
