	  "<div>Drake stands before the entrance to Ardon's legendary Catacombs. For generations these halls have been locked in an effort to contain their vile inhabitants: the Legion of the Fallen. The undead hordes of the Legion recently burst forth from the Catacombs and overtook the Stronghold, Ardon's central military outpost. Whoever controls the Stronghold controls the only road between Western and Eastern Ardon.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Supply and trade routes between the Human and Dwarven communities have been severed, and the Legion is becoming a very real threat to the surrounding communities. The crusaders of Ardon have done what they could to protect the people of Cador Sul and the Citadel, but the Legion is a formidable presence now that its occupied the Stronghold. The Stronghold is the key.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Enter Drake, a mercenary who's driven by his contempt for the Legion. Fate draws Drake to Celestia, the ruler of the Citadel and head of the Crusaders. She enlists Drake's help in the effort to regain control of the Stronghold. The Horn of Shattering is the one artifact that can bring down the Stronghold's gates. It needs to be retrieved from the Dwarves of Corantha. The only way to Corantha, unfortunately, is through the Catacombs...<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Drake unsheathes his sword and prepares for the greatest challenge of his life.<\/div>"
