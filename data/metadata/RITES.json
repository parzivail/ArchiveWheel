	  "<div>The time has come for the Eldar, minions of a dying race, to retrieve their secrets from the hands of the lesser beings. As the working leader of the dwindling Eldar forces, you must coordinate your waning culture's next stand. Combining the accessible turn-based style of Panzer General II with the gorgeous and horrifying imagery of the battle-torn WarHammer 40K universe, Rites of War brings you a strategic challenge. Fully animated figures move, attack, and die. Ambient map animations bring the battlefield to life.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Your warriors mature and strengthen along the path of your choice, so the pain of battle makes itself known with every loss. Units can learn Psyker powers, employ artifacts, and gain special abilities--if they survive. Tacticians who remember Fantasy General will feel at home in this world where storming ancient ruins can reveal powerful artifacts, unit enhancements, and powerful allies. But beware, bounty often keeps company with peril, letting death turn tomorrow's greatest hero into the Craftworld's next spirit stone. Join in the epic struggle of this Eldar confrontation, and throw yourself into an animated saga that pits your wits against a hostile cosmos.<\/div>"
