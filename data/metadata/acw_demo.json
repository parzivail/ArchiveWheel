	  "<div>It's 1861 and the nation is divided against itself. Brother against brother, father against son. You stand at the brink of one of the greatest conflicts, the American Civil War. In the next four years over 600,000 will die in America's bloodiest war. One in every three men wearing a uniform will be a casualty. The nation's greatest trial has begun.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Confederate or Union, history buff or strategic gaming fan, with its great attention to detail and dead-on realism, American Civil War is the choice for anyone ready to face the challenge of refighting and rethinking, the most devastating war in American history.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>American Civil War can be played with various political and military victory options, so you can face entirely different strategic, economic, and political challenges each time you play. Maybe you would assemble your troops differently, select more aggressive commanders, or change marching orders to alter the outcome. Test your strategies against some of the legendary leaders of this epic struggle -- you are the commander -- all the key decisions are yours!<\/div>"
