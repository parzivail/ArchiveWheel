	  "<div>4x4 is an off-road racing game. 4x4 allows you to take your favorite SUV or truck and race it in realistic off-road locations. To accurately capture the feel of off-road racing we designed the game so that there are no artificial walls to keep you on the track. In 4x4 the tracks are completely open and you can drive anywhere that your truck can take you. The game is a race from checkpoint to checkpoint. If you can find a better route than the racetrack itself, take it. In order to find out where the next checkpoint is follow the arrow. If the arrow is green you are headed in the right direction. If the arrow is red you are heading in the wrong direction. The upper left hand of the screen will show you what position you are in; your times, and what lap you are on. The map on the upper right hand side of the screen gives you a general idea of the course and where the other trucks are. Watch the map carefully as the AI does not always drive on the track. If you see an AI truck taking a short cut you might want to try it also as it may be a faster path. The lower right portion of the screen shows you your tachometer, speedometer, and gear position.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>If you ever get lost use the reset position key to reset your position to the last checkpoint that you drove through.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>At night you can use the L key to turn your headlights off or on. I recommend you drive with your headlights on though.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>If you change the weather setting to rain change your tires to a deep cut.<\/div>"
