	  "<div>Thief: The Dark Project, a first-person game, uses a complex environmental simulation coupled with an artificial intelligence system to create a rich, immersive game world that supports its core gameplay: stealth, strategy, and suspense. The player assumes the role of Garrett, a master thief living in an unnamed, ancient city in a fictional past where magic and primitive technology uneasily coexist. The city has three main factions: the mysterious Keepers, a fanatical religious sect known as the Hammers, and the pagans. As Garrett, you prey upon the city's corrupt and privileged nobility, whose wealth is at your disposal as long as their guards don't see you (or at least not until it's too late). Your success at your trade attracts the attention of a mysterious patron who offers you a fortune if you can retrieve an enormous gemstone with a notorious reputation. But it soon becomes clear that more is at stake than a comfortable retirement. Your efforts trigger a conflict between veiled powers who compete to pull your strings.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The Gold version of this game features three all-new missions in addition to finely-tuned versions of the twelve previous missions. The new levels continue the story of Garrett, a cynical, world-weary master thief in an ancient city.<\/div>"
