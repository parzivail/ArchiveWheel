	"description": [
	  "\"You wake up and look out your porthole from your bunk on board the earth's first orbiting space station, awoke by some loud screaming noises from your fellow security buddies. Some Alien society has boarded the station and has taken everyone else prisoner. By then you look out your porthole again and just in time to see a rocket fired from the station right at the earth. Moments later you gasp in disbelief as your home planet just goes up in a large flash. The aliens have vowed to destroy the station after they have done away with all of there prisoners and set the stations security system to self destruct. You must make your way to the top level of the station, fighting alien soldiers, and your own security drones(who have been reprogrammed by the aliens to destroy you),find the captured crew members, and escape the station before it blows, or disarm the self destruct mechanism in the main computer room. The Aliens have the master keys to all of the turbo lifts to get from one level to another, but some emergency keys were left behind that will only allow access to the next level up. So try to kill all of the aliens, and find all of the keys on each level. Some keys will work Turbo Lifts on other levels and some will open store rooms where armor, weapons, and health packs are stored.<br \/><br \/>\nI will leave the rest for you to figure out. On level 5 this Demo Version will end and you will be shown a Ending Screen about the Full Version. \""
