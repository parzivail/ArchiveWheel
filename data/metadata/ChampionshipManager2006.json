	  "<div>Taking what had been built in Championship Manager 5, Championship Manager 2006 made efforts to improve on what had gone before when released in March 31st 2006.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The match engine took at a lot of the focus this edition with the introduction of the \"Gameplan\" 3D match engine, a 3D representation of a football match designed to deliver a richer and more involving game experience. This took CM5's single isometric camera view and provided 11 different angles for the user to watch the match from. Further enhancements were offered as managers were given the chance to deliver their orders from the dugout and actively change the game on the fly. The introduction of the pre-match\/half-time team talks that allowed managers to motivate their squad to get the job done.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Of course this wasn't the only area to see improvements and revisions. Mangers were provided with different ways to interact with players, ranging from fines, dealing with homesickness and their relationships with other players, in total there were 32 different ways managers could interact with players.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>But before you could interact with the players, you had to get them. The transfer system was a vital part of any managers repertoire, and Championship Manager 2006 saw improvements made to the system to allow the offloading of unwanted players at the start of the season either by releasing them from contracts or offering them to other clubs. Managers could also explore their options by taking free agent\/out of contract players on free trials.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Championship Manager 2006 also made revisions to reflect the new rise in rich owners coming in to throw their money around in the Premier League, Club Benefactor was introduced allowing mega-rich owners to come in with a huge cash injection for the club. Of course with great financing came great responsibility and the pressure on the manager to deliver grew ten fold.\u00a0<\/div>"
