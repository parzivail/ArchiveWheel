	"description": [
	  "Warlords IV is a unique blend of roleplaying and turn-based strategy gaming. The game centers around your Hero, who plays a pivotal role in the success or failure of your military and economic efforts. Warlords IV is set in the troubled land of Etheria. Old foes such as Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs have resumed their ancient hostilities, and the Undead legions of Lord Bane have returned. The Knights continue their quest for dominance, and the unquiet whispers speak of the Empire, a race even more evil than the Undead.\n\nThe Heroes of Warlords IV show their mastery of sword and sorcery in the tactical combat system. Casting spells, smiting foes, or boosting morale of shaken troops, Heroes can turn the tide of battle. Players may grow and develop heroes from battle to battle, gaining in abilities and skills, and accumulating magic items and treasures.\n\nWarlords IV uses an enhanced version of the Warlords Battlecry II terrain engine to bring the splendidly rendered landscape of Etheria to life. Special spell effects will illuminate the detailed tactical battlefields, while war machines wreak death and destruction on city walls.\n\nWarlords IV will feature a new dynamic campaign with a diplomatic system to allow alliances and betrayal to play their part in the campaign story. Control of a province confers desirable and lucrative bonuses on the owner, and nobody will wish to see either their enemies or their allies get too strong.\n\nWarlords IV players will need to make judicious decisions on the economic front. Should they build new cities, upgrade existing cities or armies, teleport much needed reinforcements to the front, or spend their gold making new armies and replacing the inevitable casualties of battle?"
