	  "This demo is a snapshot in time of Warzone 2100. Warzone 2100 is currently under development and is being refined and improved daily. New features are being added, along with hundreds of new units. Instead of waiting until we finish the game, this demo gives you an opportunity to play Warzone 2100 using some of the early enemy units and structures from Campaign 1 - Western Sector.\n\nOnce you've experienced all three of Warzone 2100's campaigns, there's no going back to other action strategy games.\n\nThis multiplayer demo only allows up to four players,the retail version caters for eight, with many more options.\n\nWhen the demo begins you have already established a base and are ready to begin exploring the surrounding terrain. At the end of your first mission, your transport arrives and lets you select an away team to scout out the next mission map. While on the away team map you can continue to manufacture new units, research artifacts, and design new vehicles. You can also call in reinforcements from your base by selecting the transport icon.\n\nAt the end of this map, the demo ends. In the final Warzone 2100 game the action continues on through more maps spanning another 2 campaigns, and 36 missions. Your base will carry on for many missions, and will be subject to attack from superior enemies. This system of ongoing missions and expanding mission maps is unique to Warzone 2100 and makes for a very exciting gaming experience.\n\nThis demo pits you against Scavenger forces in the western desert. It lets you try out a few of the weapon systems in Warzone 2100 and lets you experiment with various design combinations. The full version of Warzone 2100 includes many different weapon types and structures, and takes place in urban and mountainous terrain, as well as desert terrain. As the game progresses, you encounter more powerful enemies who are equipped with medium and heavy tanks. later in the game cyborgs, howitzers, strike aircraft, hovercraft and laser weapons appear. New challenges arise regularly as the game's narrative unfolds."
