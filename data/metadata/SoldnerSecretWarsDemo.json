	"description": [
	  "After half a century of military interventions major countries like the United States of America or Russia are weary of their role as \"World Police\". The consequences of their military actions for their economy, national security, and internal ethnic conflicts let to the conclusion to tune down their military campaigns.\n\nDue to that more and more countries choose unconventional warfare by using secret Special Forces. Military success is no longer made by major countries but by small and highly specialized mercenary forces.\n\nIn \"SOLDNER - Secret Wars\" the player takes over the command of such a Special Forces team. As the Commander he leads a small high tech army consisting of soldiers, light armored vehicles, helicopters and VTOLS (Vertical Take Off and Landing Airplanes) to fulfill a wide variety of mission types .\n\nThe players units are stationed on a multi purpose ship which is camouflaged as a merchantman to allow unrestrained travel of the seas to get their forces to the area of operation.\n\nThe complete simulation of a complex political world system allows creating a dynamic campaign: each decision of the player, each success or failure has direct effect on the game flow. In addition the player has the ability to gain access to the latest weapon systems and technology, which currently exist in the research centers of the weapon industry only."
