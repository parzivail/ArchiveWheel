	  "<div>This is a demo of Incubation, a terrifying, turn-based, tactical strategy game. \u00a0You can lead a squad of marines through the first four missions of the full version or battle up to three of your friends in the unique multi-player level. Play over a LAN, the Internet, or between two PC's connected with a serial cable. Either way you'll enjoy eye-popping 3D graphics that can be viewed from almost any angle with the mouse-controlled, free-floating camera. \u00a0Incubation runs on the graphics engine from the award winning game Extreme Assault and supports many popular 3Dfx cards.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The game's simple user interface will enable you to jump right into the action with only a brief glance of this readme. \u00a0Your tactical skills will be put to the test, as you encounter deranged Scay'Ger hiding around corners and behind closed doors. \u00a0Be sure to open any chests you find on the floor to uncover pleasant surprises like ammo and equipment points for better weapons, armor and supplies.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Don't miss the two instant action bonus missions we've included in this demo. Here you'll be able to fight a larger variety of Scay'Ger with more of the nasty weapons found in the full version.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>After you've enjoyed this brief tour of duty, be sure to pick-up Incubation at your favorite retailer (release date: 10\/17\/97). \u00a0It's packed \u00a0with many more cool features like: over 30 single player missions, 12 multi-player maps, 5 instant action games, 12 weapon systems, 11 types of Scay-Ger, a unique selection of armor\/supplies and a great CD soundtrack. \u00a0You can also challenge up to three other gamers on a single computer over a LAN, the Internet or via play-by-mail.<\/div>"
