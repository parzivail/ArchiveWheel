	  "<div>Centuries of overpopulation and reckless consumption killed the earth's ecosystem. When all private industrial and governmental efforts failed to turn the tide of decay, a planetary cry of \"abandon ship!\" was declared. The most privileged section of society grabbed the space on the evacuation shuttles, while the common folk were left behind to perish. Now that a few centuries have passed, the chosen want to return, but they must battle for space on the planet they abandoned. Use your military muscle and ingenuity to wipe your enemies off the face of the earth before they do the same to you. Defeat the three different armies marching on your base from three different directions in this action-oriented game.<\/div>"
