	  "Venerated as saviors and feared as destroyers, Summoners are born into magic with an identifying mark on one hand. While their powers are unstable at best, by using Rings of Channeling, Summoners can call forth and control demons, golems, supernatural servants, and elemental creatures.\n\nIn this game, you play as the young Summoner Joseph who, in a moment of misguided heroics trying to protect his village from attackers, summoned a demon that ended up slaughtering his friends and family while he watched in horror. Over the years, the enigmatic Yago counsels and guides the youth, preparing Joseph to fulfill his prophecy. As the invading armies of Orenia march across the Medevan plain, Yago urges Joseph to quest for the ancient rings. Reluctantly, Joseph agrees. He is joined by three companions: a thief, a warrior, and a novice mage-priest whose different strengths and skills will assist the wary summoner in his search across vast and magical lands."
