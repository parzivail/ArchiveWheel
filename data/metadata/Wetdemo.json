	  "<div>Wetrix is a water based puzzle game played on a single floating, square landscape Gameplay is simple in concept but can become complex and very addictive in practice.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The player controls randomly shaped pieces which fall one at a time onto a diamond shaped landscape. Some of these pieces raise the height of this landscape where they fall and other pieces lower the land. Water bubbles also fall which break open on impact, releasing water which flows dynamically across the landscape. The player must create walls and dams to trap the water before it falls over the edge, where it will be collected in the Drain. Once the Drain is full the game is over.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>With advanced features like falling fireballs, bombs, ice cubes, and rubber duckies, Wetrix offers a mind-numbing variety of gameplay possibilities and with extra game modes such as Wetrix Classic, Wetrix Pro, Handicap modes, Challenge modes, Multiplayer modes as well as Practice modes. The variations are endless.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>This demo version of Wetrix allows three minutes of gameplay.<\/div>"
