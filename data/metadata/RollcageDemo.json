	  "The speed of each vehicle will blitz your senses. Being impact-resistant and highly flexible, the cars can flip right over onto their roofs and keep on going. The only thing that stops them is the finishing line! The cars can drive off road where the track is wide enough. Drive on the grass, the cliffs, the pavements, through roadworks, on the sides of walls, on the roof of tunnels, or anywhere you please. Some of these routes may even be shortcuts!\n\nBy destroying their weak points, you can demolish most of the objects and buildings around the tracks. Chunks of dusty rubble littering the road that was never covered in the Highway Code.\n\nWin the Gemini league to progress through to the Scorpio League and ultimately the Taurus league. Complete Rollcage in easy mode to access the HARD mode. There are four race worlds in the game with a total of twenty tracks on offer."
