	  "A client claiming to be the government of a small central African country hires granite.  Rebels working in conjunction with an established mercenary company have seized an important petroleum refining facility. Granite is to recover this property.\n\nGranite accepts the job.  Elite troops are sent in to make quick and bloodless work of the operation.  While attempting to seize the facility, Granite's forces are met with unexpectedly powerful opposition.  They are dealt a serious defeat from the rebels working with the Tetsu Yama mercenary corporation.  They are respected, feared, well equipped and very professional.\n\nAlmost entirely decimated, the few remaining Granite troops expect to be extracted.  Instead, they receive the following sat-com transmission:\n\nYOUR DEPLOYMENT IS UNAUTHORIZED AND ILLEGAL.  ALL KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR PRESENCE WILL BE DENIED.  YOUR UNIT HAS BEEN DEFUNDED.\n\n- GRANITE COMMAND\n\nBetrayed and trapped in Africa, the remaining troops decide to unite and find a way out of their situation.  You take command of the unit.  Shadow Company is born.  In your command are:\nLewis Underwood \n  - Irish, ex-IRA combatant, now freelancing. \nChloe Marco \n  - American, ex-FBI Hostage Rescue Team, in forced retirement.\nJohn Emerson \n  - American, ex-CIA now working in the private sector."
