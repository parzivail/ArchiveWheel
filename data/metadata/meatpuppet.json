	  "<div>With an enormous, smoking gun at her side, the raven-haired beauty in snug body armor spins on her spiked heel and exits the burning,blood-spattered room, leaving echoes of her light, seductive giggle behind like a parting gift. Meet Lotos Abstraction a beautiful woman with a magnificent gun. They have a working relationship. The rest is slightly more complicated.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Beneath the littered streets of Neoteric Los Angeles lurk the cannibalistic elder kin known as the Abominations. Eating the gangrenous, fleshy refuse of Embassy Corpus Delecti, these militant metahumans plot insurrection and are stockpiling armaments and medical supplies to augment their already fearsome preternatural strength. And it is here that they have cornered Lotos, short on ammo, short on temper. Your mission? Find the exit and get out alive.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Meat Puppet brings players a sophisticated story with intriguing characters, visually stunning graphics and animation, and an expansive playing universe. If they can handle it, Meat Puppet brings gamers a mega caliber brand of third-person, isometric-view action game combined with obstacle and puzzle solving. The designers created this micromission and engineered it for maximum violence density. All rooms are unique and don't appear anywhere else.<\/div>"
