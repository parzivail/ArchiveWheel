	  "<div>HardBall 6 offers a new 3D engine and a number of additions to the last version. This update boasts motion-captured polygonal players and a new fielding model that lets players dive in eight directions, jump, and execute a variety of plays such as the \"\"basket\"\" catch. It also allows for situational hitting, which lets the user control whether to hit the ball in the air for a possible sacrifice fly, hit the ball on the ground for a hit and run, or hit to the opposite field. The Consecutive Season Play feature allows for players to age, causing their skills to either improve or deteriorate. As a result, the process of managing teams becomes more strategic. HardBall 6 features an All-Time team that has 24 of the best players in the game's history, including such greats as Babe Ruth, Dizzy Dean, Jackie Robinson, Lou Gehrig, and Whitey Ford. The game sports official team logos and all 30 stadiums, including the new Comiskey Park in Chicago and the soon-to-be-constructed PacBell Park in San Francisco. It also features robust multiplayer action via the Internet, LAN, or modem and includes support for Direct3D as well as keyboard, joystick, or gamepad controllers. In the demo version you can play three complete exhibition innings.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Multiple players can take part in this new-and-improved version of the demo via serial, modem, or TCP (through an Internet connection). The multiplayer option will not work between this demo and the full retail version.<\/div>"
