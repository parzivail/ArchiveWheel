	  "<div>Evochron Alliance is the sequel to the original Evochron with a lot of design aspects heavily influenced by player feedback and requests. It is a first person 3D space combat, trader, and mercenary simulation. You can make diverse buying, fighting, and travelling decisions in a large universe without the hesitation of turn-based gameplay or the reduced immersion of an overhead\/outside view. You are literally in the action with a consistent first person viewpoint and make all gameplay decisions directly from the cockpit.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Evochron Alliance offers many unique space combat and trading elements, including a real-time dynamic changing economy, seamless environment transitions, multi-level threat system, commodity\/item trading, ship-to-ship trading in all gameplay modes, planetary descents, diverse control support (Mouse, Keyboard, AND Joystick control options), unrestricted open space jump drive travel and navigation system, realistic Newtonian physics, unified single player and multiplayer architecture, fuel resource management, per ship bribing, realistic revolving inventory availability, in-cockpit inventory and trade management, gravity effects, AI based trade negotiating, and more.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Complete control and consistent player interaction are additional unique and important qualities which add to the immersion and realism of the game. Unlike most other recent space-sims, you aren't pulled away from flight control when you get close to a planet or other object in space. You are in control of your ship the entire time, including docking and jump drive travel. Evochron doesn't pull you out of the action for a non-interactive cut scene or menu sequence. You're in control during all gameplay.<\/div>"
