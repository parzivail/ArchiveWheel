	  "<div>Spellcross is one of the few fantasy role-playing turn-based strategy games to ever come out of the Czech republic and is available now on PC CD-ROM. \"They bring fear and panic under the cover of an impenetrable fog, the entire planet is ablaze. The formation of the Worldwide Alliance is mankind\u2019s last sparkle of hope. Ancient magical powers have invaded our world and threatened to wipe out mankind forever. Murdering hordes of Chaos warriors serving the Forces of Darkness spread across the planet, annihilating any resistance they encounter. The remaining armies prepare themselves for a desperate last strike of resistance as the Dark magic spreads across the land, causing the dead to rise from their graves. The question remains, is there any hope of survival? The last battle has begun...\"\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>In this unique strategy game you take on the character of John Alexander and experience apocalyptic war first hand. The objective of the game is to get to the top of the hierarchy of command and save the world. The game is split into two levels - strategic and tactical. In the strategic part, you decide on the most suitable territory for attack, the division of financial resources, the composition and organisation of the army, and the direction of research. In the tactical part the actual battle within each territory takes place. During the battle, you have to allocate a specific number of action points per unit, for moving, attacking or other special activities.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>As you are promoted to higher ranks your share of responsibility becomes bigger. You will find yourself leading troops, modern tank divisions, air squadrons, heavy artillery and elite infantry brigade, across grassy plains and hot deserts, fighting to save the world. You will face the might of bloodthirsty Orcs, merciless elves and ranks of Skeletal Warriors. It's a game of skill and precision thinking.\u00a0<\/div>"
