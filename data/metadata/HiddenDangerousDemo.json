	  "Hidden & Dangerous is an action\/real-time strategic game, containing a combination of non-traditional features, elements of real time strategy, action games and partly tactical strategies. Plentiful new features and stunning true 3D graphics give the game original form and dynamic pace. The story is imaginative and full of reversals and forces the player to think ahead all the time.\n\nHidden & Dangerous takes place during World War II. The story begins in 1941 and, provided that you choose the correct course of action, you can get to the end of the war in 1945. Player's task is to lead a small group of Allies soldiers (up to 4 people) who carry-out difficult missions deep in enemy territory. Missions take place in six different localities.\n\nHidden & Dangerous is simply not a game about blindly bursting into a room, shooting at anything that moves. You have to carefully consider each your step. We are convinced that \"Hidden & Dangerous\" game will make it to the top of market with computer action\/real-time strategic games. It is a giant, mega-lo-manic game."
