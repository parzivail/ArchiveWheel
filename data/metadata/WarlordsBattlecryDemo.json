	  "Real-Time strategy had no room for heroics....Until now. The question is, will you be the hero of your race, or just another soldier in the field? Warlords Battlecry takes real-time strategy gameplay into the next generation with hero-based gameplay. Create a hero in one of nine races and then take him and his armies through campaigns, quests and multiplayer games. The nine races include: humans, dwarfs, orcs, minotaurs, undead, high elf, dark elf, wood elf, and barbarian. Hero's Command Radius\nYour hero and his armies must set out, on either a path of good or a path of evil, to destroy the Two Tears (two powerful and mystical meteorites) before they fall into the wrong hands. As you win scenarios, campaigns or multiplayer games and your hero gains experience he will be able to choose a specialty class that will strengthen his attributes. The four broad classes include warrior, priest, thief, and wizard.\n\nYour hero becomes an extension of you, the gameplayer, because of the time you'll invest to create and develop the hero. Warlords Battlecry brings a Dungeons and Dragons\/RPG aspect to the RTS genre. Your hero continues to develop over time, no matter the type of game you play.\n\nYour heroes' characteristics are retained between scenarios, campaigns and multiplayer games. In addition you can carry armies, with your hero, between any two scenarios.\n\nNot only does the hero involve you to a greater extent in gameplay; he also affects gameplay through his command radius. The command radius is a specified area around the hero. When the hero gains bonuses he can pass these on to any of his armies within his command radius, making his armies more powerful.\n\nUnlike previous RTS games where you control nameless armies, Warlords BattleCry allows you to create, grow and develop a connection with your hero. So, get ready for the next hero in real-time strategy gaming- You."
