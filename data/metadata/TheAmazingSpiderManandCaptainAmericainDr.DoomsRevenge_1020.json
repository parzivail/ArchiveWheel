	  "\"Dear Mighty Marvel Computer Whiz:\n\nZoom back in time, in your imagination, to the early days of World War II. America needed a hero to inspire us in the fight against Nazi tyranny\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20acand it got one! His name was Steve Rogers, but the world knew him as the star-spangled sentinel of liberty, Captain America!\n\nNow, rocket ahead twenty-two years to 1963, when a shy high-school student was bitten by a radioactive spider. His name was Peter Parker, but he gained world-wide fame as the wall-crawling, web-swinging, wise-cracking Amazing Spider-Man!\n\nSince those early days, these death-defying national icons, Captain America and Spider-Man, have become two of the most exciting and admired superheroes of all.\n\nComicbooks have evolved rapidly during the last fifty years, from the comicbook itself, to cartoons, television series, full-length motion pictures, and finally to entertainment software for the home computer. At the same time, the audience for the comicbook heroes has grown by leaps and bounds. Just think, when Captain America first appeared in the late '30s, computers didn't even exist! Even in the early '60s, when Spidey exploded upon the scene, computers as we know them were still in their infancy!\n\nBut the times they are a'changin'! Today, in the high-tech world of 1989, the computer has become an indispensable tool for education, finance, communication, correspondence, and of course\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20acentertainment. The entertainment software industry is burgeoning as new and more innovative concepts are created daily, and more and more computers are introduced into the home.\n\nAlways on the cutting edge of the future, mighty Marvel Comics is proud to join this new, exciting field of entertainment software with SPIDER-MAN AND CAPTAIN AMERICA IN DR. DOOM'S REVENGE, a challenging and sophisticated new game developed by Paragon Software Corporation.\n\nJust think! An original Marvel comic book sets the stage for the incredible adventure to follow. The game itself becomes an interactive comicbook, continuing where the original illustrated saga ends! So instead of just reading a comicbook panel, you can control the fate of Spidey and Cap as they face some of the most spine-tingling, challenging arcade sequences ever created!\n\nYou will help your two colorful Super-Heroes in their life-and-death struggle against some of the most powerful and destructive Super-Villains of all, including Batroc, Machete, The Hobgoblin, Oddball and other equally fearsome foes!\n\nYou'll discover full-screen color graphics, lightning-fast animation and awesomely realistic sound as you face one of the most challenging and thrill-packed games ever created.\n\nBest of all, with the development of this first interactive comicbook adventure, the entire Super-Hero concept has taken a giant step forward. Just imagine battling shoulder-to-shoulder with Spidey and Cap as you actually participate in adventures that, up till now, you were only able to read about!\n\nSo, dare to accept the challenge of a lifetime and join forces with your bullpen buddies and Paragon Software as we prepare to take the Marvel Comics Universe into the Twenty-First Century! Think of the wonderment that lies ahead!\""
