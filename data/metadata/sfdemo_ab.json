	  "<div>Game Notes<\/div><div>----------<\/div><div>You are now looking at the first playable preview of Star Fighter for the PC!<\/div><div>This game was designed to take advantage of a Pentium processor [The<\/div><div>programmers at Krisalis hand-coded each line in assembly from the original<\/div><div>3DO version].<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>To see the true power of the graphics engine, try it out on a P133 or better<\/div><div>with a PCI graphics card. \u00a0Of course, Star Fighter supports all ranges of<\/div><div>machines down to a 486, but nothing can beat the experience of flying around<\/div><div>and destroying massive chains of buildings in hi-res 640x480 at 24 frames<\/div><div>per second. \u00a0Just compare Star Fighter against the competition to see the<\/div><div>superior graphics quality in hi-resolution.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>If you own a 486, Star Fighter will run extremely fast in low-resolution<\/div><div>mode, plus we will soon be supporting Creative Labs' 3D Blaster!<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>History<\/div><div>-------<\/div><div>If you are at all familiar with the 3DO version of Star Fighter, you will<\/div><div>notice right away that the PC edition bears as little resemblance to its<\/div><div>predecessor as it did to the Archimedes classic. \u00a0For one, the game engine<\/div><div>now utilizes a natural fogging technique to bring terrain into view without<\/div><div>pop-up. \u00a0We have also added realistic textures to every object among the 8<\/div><div>planet types, ranging from photographic quality grass, water, ice, and rock<\/div><div>to steel and glass skyscrapers. \u00a0All 60 maps have been updated and all<\/div><div>fighter craft enhanced with additional polygon and texture detail.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Best of all, we have retained the same playability that made the original<\/div><div>game so great. \u00a0A few logical loopholes have been closed here and there,<\/div><div>and the mission objectives have been tweaked to provide an extremely<\/div><div>challenging game with plenty of hidden features. \u00a0Hunting for crystal<\/div><div>combinations is now more convenient with the addition of a ship-board<\/div><div>analytical computer, and an altimeter makes cockpit control easier for<\/div><div>flight simulator enthusiasts.<\/div>"
