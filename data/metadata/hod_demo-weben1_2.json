	  "<div>In a world just like our own (except for the side-scrolling) lives Andy, a boy like any other; his teacher hates him, and his dog adores him. The thing that really scares him is the dark. To rescue his doggy pal, Whisky, snatched away by the forces of darkness, Andy must face his darkest fears in a secret kingdom, a world of soul-hungry phantoms, bedtime demons, manic monsters, and bizarre friends. Only you can control Andy's destiny, hold back the forces of evil, and ultimately confront the sinister Master of Darkness. You climb, swing, twist, swim, and shoot (with a weapon that resembles the ones used in Ghostbusters) your way through a world filled with mystical mazes, exotic landscapes, and evil enemies. You fight in eight huge levels inhabited by Shades and Dark Souls.<\/div>"
