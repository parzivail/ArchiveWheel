	  "\"An ancient, alien power rooted in the bowels of the planet Ioxia (eye-OH-sha) has sprung back to life, halting all mining on Ioxia's three moons; the only known sources of the precious element, Mazrium. Mazrium is the basis for all current technologies and power sources, and also has life-giving properties. It is vital to the survival of the inhabitants of this galaxy.\n\nTwo days ago, an energy surge on the planet was detected by one of the orbiting mining vessels. The surge originated from within the only remaining Ioxian Citadel (left from the \u00e2Great Uprising\u00e2 two centuries ago). A squad of Cyrops mercenaries was sent in to investigate.\n\nThe satellite feed that was received indicated something has risen from the ashes and is attempting to regain control of the Mazrium.\n\nMoments after their insertion, the Cyrops mercs were destroyed. The Citadel from ages past had snapped to life - reinstating the ion shield that prevents access to the three Mazrium moons and sending the entire galaxy into chaos.\n\nNo Armada can penetrate the shield; no weapons can disable the Citadel. Strategists believe a single soldier could slip past the defenses which were designed for large scale assaults and shut down the shield's power source from within. The Mazrium must be mined; it is the lifeblood of the galaxy.\n\nThe Universal Mining Guild has called upon the services of their most ambitious mercenary, Eleena Brynstaarl. In this desperate hour, they are more than willing to meet her demanded price.\n\nThe planet of Treydan has selected their most impressive warrior to be sent in search of a solution to the dilemma facing the galaxy. Kamchak possesses both the strength and the sheer will that such a mission requires. A hero of the galaxy is in the making.\n\nTrapped on one of the Mazrium moons when the Ioxian Citadel kicked on, Dan Blaze wasn't looking for anything but his next load of Mazrium to mine. Now that all his fellow cybernetic miners are dead, he must find a way off of this lifeless world. The only course of action seems to be deeper exploration of the strange Citadel controlling the ion shield. \""
