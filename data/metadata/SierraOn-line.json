	],
	"description": [
	  "\"LOOKING FOR A GOOD TIME?\n\nMEET LARRY. He's just turned 40 and he's still single. If you can get past the glow of his Grecian formula you can see his hairline beginning to make a hasty retreat from his forehead. Larry's leisure suit is of the highest quality (!00% man-made material, permanent press, too!). He wears at least 11 gold chains, and his freshly-capped teeth could blind you in a bright light. Down at the singles bar he tells the chicks, sure I'm single I got in a fight with my ol' lady and she threw me out. He doesn't tell them the 'ol' lady' was his mom, or that he was 38 at the time.\n\nYEAH, LARRY'S A JERK He's the ultimate blind date nightmare. The kind of guy you wouldn't want your daughter to meet, let alone date. But he's also become an unlikely cult-hero of the computer age. And he's the star of this new version of the 3-D Adventure Game classic.\n\n3-D EQUALS DANCING, DRINKING, AND DAMES! Become the lovable nerd Larry for one fabulous night. You'll drink. You'll gamble. And, if you play your cards right, you might even meet the girl (or girls) of your dreams. Leisure Suit Larry is a humorous, harmless endeavor for adults. The object of the game is to help Larry over-come his jerkisms and lose his \u00e2you know what\u00e2. It's a silly, risque romp through the singles' scene and a challenging adventure game that will test your street smarts and suave sophistication. So slip into your leisure suit and venture out into the land of the lounge lizards. We guarantee it will be a night you'll never forget. \""
