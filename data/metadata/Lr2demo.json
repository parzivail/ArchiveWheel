	  "<div>Lode Runner 2 offers everything players liked about the original version, and demands the same timing, resourcefulness, and cunning. Now you'll be searching for gold and avoiding monsters in a three-dimensional world, using your wiliness to figure out how to outsmart each level, just like in the first one. The demo version gives you 5 levels from one world, which you play as the yellow male Lode Runner in single-player mode. If you register, you get 5 worlds with 75 levels, the ability to play as one of 8 colored Lode Runners (male or female), multiplayer support for up to 8 players over a LAN using TCP\/IP, and many new objects, such as the Cloak of the Mad Monk and directional bombs. With the full version, you also get a level editor for creating your own levels and worlds to trade or play yourself.<\/div>"
