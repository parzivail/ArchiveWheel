	  "<div>In the not-too-distant future, a nuclear war has destroyed most of the Earth's population and much of the land is uninhabitable, except for a handful of \"safe zones.\" The government established the Emergency Containment Organization (ECO), an agency designed to screen all of the population for the optimal use of these safe zones. Those deemed physically and mentally stable are allowed to remain within the city limits, and the remainder are labeled undesirable and cast out to the wastelands. These unfortunate souls became scavengers in the post apocalyptic wilderness, fighting for their survival, thus earning the name \"Raiders.\"\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>As a Raider, you will enter the safe zones forbidden to you, and retrieve, destroy or activate various items which will allow you to survive in this savage world. During your raids, you must elude capture by Zone Patrols, and battle enemy vehicles utilizing an array of weapons.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>ZONE RAIDERS is a fast-paced, real time driving combat game that takes place in a futuristic, 3D graphics environment. In the game, the player is an independent Raider who must enter a zone and retrieve, destroy, or activate various items, and then escape successfully. In order to get at these items the player must battle enemy vehicles which, like the player's vehicle, resemble ancient automobiles from the mid to late 20th century, enhanced with hover plates and heavy artillery.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>In this barren and desolate world of the future, only two things matter - speed and survival. You will travel at break-neck speed, as you invade and defend the variable landscapes of the dark future, in your beefed-up and heavily armed \"vintage\" automobile. ZONE RAIDERS features fast paced action, quality 3D vehicles and environments, and exciting game play. Players can play single player, or multi-player network games.\u00a0<\/div>"
