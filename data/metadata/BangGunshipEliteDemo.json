	  "The Alliance of the 3 Races have always had their conflicts with the Sektar, the evil race that was excluded from the Alliance so many years ago. \n\nMany of us have lost members of our families for generations because of their teacherous attacks on unprotected outposts of our alliance. Until now we have managed to avoid a large scale conflict but we have learned that the Sektar have recruited the infamous Morgoths and intend to wipe us out forever, in order to have free access to the Kha. Whether we want to or not, we have to face this horrendous threat. Once again we have called on the skills and courage of our Allied Arikhans, to protect us. All Arikhan military forces have therefore been called to weapons. I regret to have to inform you we are in a state of war.\" \n\nThe Player is Xaha, a young talented Arikhan fighterpilot. He has got his own fighter sooner than was meant, but enormous losses in the first encounters with the enemy have made it necessary to replace more experienced pilots already. The losses are so big that Xaha often has to face the enemy alone...Combat information says the first mission of the enemy is to destroy the Dagon-bases, since they are considered the brains in the Alliance."
