	  "<div>You are one of the elite pilots who has been enlisted in the allied special ops Gear unit created by the now-allied Confederated Northern City-States and the Allied Southern Territories to ward off enemy invasions of Terra Nova, and you will be outfitted with top-of-the-line Gear equipment to match your elite warrior status. Your unit is to be transported to planet Caprice, the strategically important \"\"Gate World\"\" that connects all of mankind's interstellar settlements and serves as the enemy's base for launching invasions against Terra Nova. Advance behind enemy lines and gain intelligence to be used against the enemy.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The three-mission Heavy Gear II demo features one single-player mission that will not be included in the final game. Also, players can pilot their Gears for the first time in true zero-G space combat, as well as a dense swamp environment in the demo's two multiplayer missions. The game features an entirely new 3D hardware-only engine that delivers fast combat action, true physics, photo-realistic graphics, and complex battlefields that include numerous vehicles and structures, flying debris, and fire and smoke.<\/div>"
