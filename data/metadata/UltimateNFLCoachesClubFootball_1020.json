	  "\"NFL COACHES CLUB FOOTBALL\n\nAre you ready for some football? NFL Coaches Club Football will give you all you can handle. Produced by the people who specialize in realism, NFL Coaches Club Football is the simulation for real football fanatics.\n\nNFL Coaches Club Football gives you full 3-D views of the action -- on the gridiron, where the game is really decided. Using hundreds of real NFL plays, you make all the coaching decisions. If you like, you can control key players in the action to experience the brute power of the running game, or the finesse of the passing game! A powerful Instant Replay feature lets you save replays of your team's greatest moments for posterity. Pick and change formations, call audibles, even design your own plays. NFLCC Football simulates all the variables that make the game exciting and unpredictable.\n\nYou'll be competing against other NFL teams based on their actual strengths, weaknesses and unique coaching strategies. Playing quarterback against Jimmy Johnson will have you squirming in your arm chair. The crafty Marv Levy will learn your tendencies and change his game plan to counter your strategy.\n\nGlanville, Schottenheimer, Shula, and the rest -- they're the best there is, and they're gunning for you. This simulation is pure football; your chance to beat the NFL coaches at their own game.\""
