	  "<div>The stories in which fantasy has an outstanding role are always welcomed by the fans. In this sense, \"Digital Dreams\" proposes a videogame in which we\u00b4ll feel transported to another world, and even to another dimension. \"Ancient Evil\" constitutes a vehicle to feel we are part of an exciting argument that wraps us as soon as we get into it.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The Crypt of the Ancients was built 500 years ago, with the finality of offering a place for rest to the Ancients, who are the supposed creators of the world, and no one, but two exceptions, got to come out of it alive. Alaric, a mysterious and restless man, and one of the two fortunate people that got the mentioned achievement, has converted the crypt in his particular shelter . From there, he challenges the world by offering a reward of 50.000 gold coins to whom can penetrate into the place and coming out alive to tell the carefully kept secret.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>For centuries, many would-be heroes tried to uncover these secrets with no success, because the powerful spirits living inside the crypt ended the lives of those who try to defy them. To warn the incautious people who feel with strength, capacity and courage to assume the challenge of Alaric, it emerges the spirit of Jetraal the Heroic, who died three centuries ago in mysterious circumstances and was the other one who escaped alive from this restless place. His mission is to warn any person who tries to assume the risk that it is an adventure sentenced to failure in advance, as well as to annul the malicious instincts of Alaric.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>\"Ancient Evil\" is a 3D role playing game that uses high resolution graphics in a completely interactive environment, which provides it intensity and helps to wrap the player immediately. The people who plays this game introduce themselves into a story of magicians, mystic arts and illusions where there\u00b4s no lack of hand to hand combats and incantations.\u00a0<\/div>"
