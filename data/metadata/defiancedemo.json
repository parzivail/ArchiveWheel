	  "<div>Military research laboratories are developing a biomechanical weapon, part biological for intelligence and adaptability and part mechanical for destructive force. The project is not going well and funding is cut off. Upon hearing this, the scientist who developed the weapons goes berserk and vows revenge. You are a test pilot of an experimental ground effects vehicle designed as a powerful one-man gun ship. During what at first appears to be a routine vehicle and weapons test flight, walls come crashing down and the test escalates into a battle for humanity's very existence. This is a first-person shooter from Avalon Hill, the company well known for its turn-based computer and strategy board games. This game continues the spirit of Descent and Dark Forces. A joystick and Pentium 133 or faster is recommended for optimum performance and higher resolution.<\/div>"
