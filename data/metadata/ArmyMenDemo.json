	  "Mixing childhood imagination with real world environments, 3DO's Army Men game brings to life the plastic military units we all played with as kids. It's tactical action like you've always imagined. Melt 'em, shoot 'em, and blow them up; just like you did back then... but be careful- this time, they shoot back. Be Sarge and command a unit to DEFEND, ATTACK, or FOLLOW. Call in AIRSTRIKES; send in PARATROOPERS, but make sure to get a good picture of the land with an AIR-RECON first. Guide Sarge into multiple vehicles, like the TANK, the JEEP, and more. Blast your way through enemy territory but be smart so you can fight another day. It's Army Men, enlist now!!"
