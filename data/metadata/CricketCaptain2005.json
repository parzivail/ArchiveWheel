	  "<div>International Cricket Captain 2005 is the ultimate cricket management sim, allowing you to take charge of any domestic or international team and steer them to victory through every match of the season. You control all aspects of the team s progress, from transfers, team selection, and training: to detailed match tactics. Choose your bowlers, plan their line of attack, set their fields, and then watch the highlights to see if you got that vital breakthrough. Ask your batsmen to make hay while the sun shines or defend through the fading light. Prepare the pitch, bowl over or around the wicket, and choose to watch the action ball-by-ball or over-by-over. Experience the highs and lows of international cricket management with Cricket Captain 2005. Based on a brand new database and featuring an all-new interface, superb extra commentary by the BBC's Jonathan Agnew, Cricket Captain has returned.\u00a0<\/div>"
