	  "<div>It\u2019s late September, and you\u2019re in the dog-days of a heated pennant race. You check the out of town scoreboard, and your division rival is currently winning their game handily with their ace on the mound.<\/div><div>You\u2019re down by two with runners on first and second with 2 out in the bottom of the 9th , facing your opponent\u2019s flame-throwing closer.<\/div><div>Due up is your shortstop who has always had trouble against right-handed pitching.\u00a0<\/div><div>However, you have a secret weapon sitting on the bench.<\/div><div>A couple weeks ago, you completed a deal after the trading deadline to bring in a veteran left-handed hitter for just such an occasion. Sure, it was tough letting go of one of your highly-touted pitching prospects, but you needed to make a deal to get your team over the hump.<\/div><div>Confident, you call your shortstop back from the on-deck circle, and announce your recent acquisition as the new pinch-hitter. Now, it\u2019s all in his hands \u2013 are you the hero, or the goat?<\/div>"
