	"description": [
	  "Samurai Warfare on an epic scale, thousands of warriors in battle, 8 rival factions, intrigue, assassinations, subterfuge and honour.  Realtime battles on a 3D terrain, all controlled with a simple \"point and click\".  Shogun is...Total War.\n\nThis demo is designed to introduce you to the Shogun: Total War battlefield, just one part of the full Shogun:Total War game.  The demo will guide you through a number of tutorials that will introduce you to some of the unit types and teach you some of the skills necessary to become a great Daimyo.  You will then be able to put some of those skills into practice in a few small battles.  \n\nNOTE:  There are 3 different battles in the 'Learn from the past' tutorial.  The battle you play is chosen at random so you can play this lesson a number of times to test your skill.\n\nIn order to progress through the various lessons, you must complete each of them successfully.  This demo does not cover the strategy part of the game - which includes assassinations, espionage, treaties, strategic conquest and technological research.  \n\nThe game itself is at an 'Alpha' stage and therefore the final gameplay is still getting worked on and will change significantly from the Tutorial test."
