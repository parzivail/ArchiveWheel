	  "Created for the Retro Remakes 2008 contest 'We Like It Retro' category. Graphics pixelled using resolution and color palette of the Amstrad CPC range of computers in their 16 Mode 0 resolution.<div><br \/><\/div><div><div>Aim of the demo is to get to the end of the level shooting the enemies, exploring the map and finding power ups. Some doors will block access to later parts of the level. \u00a0Find the matching color lock device and destroy it to open these doors. \u00a0There is no boss in this demo (I broke it), so just getting to the very end of the level is the end of the demo.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Collect orbs for extra points. \u00a0Collect one hundred for an extra life. \u00a0Green orbs are the most common but occasionally you'll come across pink orbs. \u00a0These are worth five of the green ones.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>There are two types of gun in the demo. \u00a0Blaster gives a concentrated burst of flamey goodness. \u00a0Multiple lets you shoot several shots out at same time in different directions in front of the player. \u00a0There is supposed to be a third weapon though I broke that too so it's not in the demo. The guns can be upgraded a couple of times (their final maximum power stage is not in this demo, neither are smart bombs), and dying will revert the gun's power back down one.<\/div><\/div><div><br \/><\/div>"
