	  "<div>A15x6 is a one person game. There are nine squares arranged in a 3 x 3 pattern, that is, three squares to a side. Each of the nine squares has a unique color and letter. The letters go from A through I. Hidden under the letters are the numbers 1 through 9. The sum of the three numbers in each row is shown to the right of the row. The sum of the three numbers in a column is shown below the column. Sometimes the sum of the numbers in each of the two diagonals are shown below and to the left and to the right of the lower end of the diagonals. When A15x6 first comes up, the letters appear in alphabetical order: left to right, top to bottom. The sums of the hidden numbers are not visible at this time. To the left of the large square are eight circles arranged in two columns. The left column is used for playing the \"Easy\" version of the game while the ones on the right are for the \"Hard\" version. The numbers inside the circles represent minutes. When you are ready to start playing, select one of the circles by clicking in it with the left mouse button. This will set the type of game and the amount of play time.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>After clicking in one of the circles, they will be replaced by a set of three boxes. The topmost box shows the amount of play time remaining, in seconds. Below that is the time used up. At the bottom is the score. The sums of rows and columns will also appear. In the Hard game, you will also see the totals of the two diagonals.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The object of the game is to make the sums of each row and each column become 15. In addition, in the Hard game, the sum of the two diagonals must also become 15. Each time you manage to do this, your score goes up by 10.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>At the beginning of each game, the hidden numbers are scrambled randomly so that each game is different. The exception to this is the Demo Version where the numbers start out in the same positions each time. You play by swapping squares. This changes the row and column (and diagonal) totals. To swap, you click, drag and drop with the left mouse button. You keep doing this until all the large blue numbers become 15. If you have more time left, click anywhere on the board and a new game will begin.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>When time runs out, you can start a new series of games. You will see the circles again and you will be able\u00a0<\/div>"
