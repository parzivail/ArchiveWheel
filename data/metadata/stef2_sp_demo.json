	  "<div>A terrifying evil has awakened. Hordes of nightmarish creatures are attacking ships and colonies throughout the galaxy. Evolved for combat, their armies have made easy work of the opposition. Now, it's up to the Hazard Team to respond. Lead your highly trained squad from volcanic worlds to deadly swamps, from starship hulls to the underground cities of long-vanished races, from mercenary space stations to ice planets. Bring the fight to the enemy as the twisting plot unfolds. Seek to uncover the mysterious origins of the invaders, discover secret enemy alliances and subterfuge, and eliminate the enemy threat once and for all.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>This 118MB download contains a small portion of gameplay from two of the missions in Star Trek Elite Force II. Within the demo, you will fight against several Exomorph creatures, which represent a small sampling of the wide variety of monsters and different humanoids you will encounter in the full version of the game.<\/div>"
