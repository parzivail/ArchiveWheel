	  "By the middle of the third millenium, the mega-corporations that rule on Earth are locked in a cutthroat race to colonize space and claim its vast resources. The rule of the law applies on Earth only; in space, it's the law of the jungle. \n\nYou join Project Freedom, a corporation enjoying a relatively clean reputation, as a spaceship pilot. The game's campaign includes 21 missions in breathtaking settings. Locations within the Solar System are based on actual real-life data for specific locales. Thus, you'll be able to see what the Marineris Valley on Mars looks like, up close... what it feels like to fly through the asteroid belt... and experience the universe from the surface of Io, one of Jupiter's moons. Full 3D special effects enhanced by cutting-edge technology such as Pixel Shader 2.0 turn each mission into a mindblowing spectacle.\n\nAs you progresses through the campaign, Project Freedom scientists invent new weapons and systems enhancements for your Epsilon fighter. These become very useful, for it quickly becomes apparent the familiar Solar System hides many secrets and surprises. These include time warps and dimension folds that act as portals to other galaxies. Before long, you find yourself facing a much deadlier enemy than the pilots fighting for rival corporations."
