To accurately capture the feel of off-road racing we designed the game so that there are no artificial walls to keep you on the track. In 4x4 the tracks are completely open and you can drive anywhere that your truck can take you. The game is a race from checkpoint to checkpoint. If you can find a better route than the racetrack itself, take it. In order to find out where the next checkpoint is follow the arrow. If the arrow is green you are headed in the right direction. If the arrow is red you are heading in the wrong direction. The upper left hand of the screen will show you what position you are in; your times, and what lap you are on. The map on the upper right hand side of the screen gives you a general idea of the course and where the other trucks are. Watch the map carefully as the AI does not always drive on the track. If you see an AI truck taking a short cut you might want to try it also as it may be a faster path. The lower right portion of the screen shows you your tachometer, speedometer, and gear position. If you ever get lost use the reset position key to reset your position to the last checkpoint that you drove through. At night you can use the L key to turn your headlights off or on.

The sum of the three numbers in a column is shown below the column.

But that was before someone destroyed his home and kidnapped his girlfriend. Now a conspiracy involving a company called Medtech is hunting him down. His fiancee, Maria, may have been taken for experimentation with a lethal stimulant called Adrenix.

	"description": "\"Below is a *basic* explanation of the rules of Avalon Hill's Advanced Civilization (ACIV), enough to let you try out the demo and decide if the game is for you. ACIV is based on an AH board game with a reputation as being an excellent pure strategy game whose only disadvantage is that in order to play you need to find 4 or 5 like minded players willing to sit down for a marathon session of 6-8 hours or more. The game is no relation to Sid Meier's Civilization, and predates it by 12 or 15 years, but does have a few similarities, most notably the importance in the game of obtaining advances (called TOOLS in ACIV) in the technical, artistic, and philosophical sophistication of your culture. It is a good guess that Sid Meier had some exposure to AH's game and that it influenced his design. ACIV models the period of time from the Stone Age thru the Late Iron Age, and takes place in the historical \"\"Cradle of Civilization\"\" - the area around the Mediterranean Sea. The object of the game is to be the first civilization to move your token to the right hand side of the \"\"AST\"\", a track showing advances thru the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age. You move on the AST based on how many and what type \"\"TOOLS\"\" (such as Astronomy, Law, Pottery) you have and how many \"\"CITIES\"\" you have. At the start of the game you put down tokens to indicate your population, which increases each turn, in territories on the map. There is a limit as how many population tokens can be in each area indicated on the area, and if you have excess at the end of a turn you lose them. In the first part of the game you want to move your tokens (moving to adjacent areas) so as to carve out a largish rural empire. Later, you may move population tokens via ships built using taxes you have accumulated (cities-see below-yield taxes), with the ships having the ability to move several areas along the coast (and further out to sea once the Astronomy \"\"TOOL\"\" is acquired). All conflict is resolved purely by removing tokens in equal numbers from each side, with _no_ random elements. Remember the object is _NOT_ to conquer the entire map (token limit for each player prevents that in any case), but only to give yourself some room to advance and... build CITIES. If you put 6 tokens in a area which is marked as a good city site (red or yellow squares on the map), instead of losing the extra token at the end of the turn, _all_ the tokens are replaced by a *city*, _and_ at the end of the turn (for each city) you get a TRADING CARD which is symbolic of some common trade commodity from the period such as hides, wine, or gems. The cards all have values from 1 to 9, and are drawn from stacks sorted by value, so that you will tend to get only low cards if you have only a few cities and higher value cards if you have more. You accumulate cards and then trade them in on TOOLS (see above) each round if you desire. You can also trade the cards with other players, with the condition that you must offer sets of 3 cards, telling honestly what 2 of them are, and bluffing, if you wish, about the 3rd. Trading of cards to make _sets_ is important, as sets have numeric value over and above the the numbers on each card. There are also disaster cards, some of which can be dumped in trading, which cause floods, revolts, etc. There's a lot more to the game, but this should get you started and let you experiment. Remember the ultimate goal is to advance your civilization, so direct your strategy toward acquiring trade goods and converting them to TOOLS. The demo is a \"\"generous\"\" one, and will let you play over half of a full game, giving you a score and rating when it ends. Advanced Civilization is a truely superior strategy game with lots of opportunities for various approaches depending on your starting civilization, your territorial position, and your approach to trade and advancement. It has the further benefit of being finely tuned and play balanced due to it's board game heritage.\"",

Remember that the Sopwith Camel would give off no radar signature, and the full-throttle jet would have to rely on visual sighting. Now things get interesting_ That's the premise behind Air Duel, Micro-Prose's new dogfighting game that lets you pit planes of different eras against each other in scintillating battles that test your cunning in new, amazing ways. Air Duel makes a great introductory combat flight simulator as well, because it places a great deal more emphasis on fast action than on the ultra-realism common to most simulations in the genre. \"\"Air Duel is designed for the flight simulation novice who wants to learn the basics of dogfighting in a new, exciting, and challenging way,\"\" said Product Manager Carl Knoch. \"\"But it's also a fascinating experience for even the most experienced simulation buffs.\"\" Air Duel becomes even more exciting in its two-player (modem play) mode. Now gamers can take on their friends in the aircraft of their choice, in any of six different eras of aviation history: World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, The Falklands, and the Middle East. Among the aircraft you can fly are the Sopwith Camel, the Spitfire, the F-86, the F-4 Phantom, the Harrier Jump Jet, the F-16, the Fokker DR1, and the MiG-23. \"\"The potential matchups aren't as lopsided as you would think,\"\" Carl adds. \"\"Planes from different eras each had different strengths, including maneuverability, speed, or armament. Heat-seeking missiles, for instance, do no good if they can't find the target. \"\"Air Duel is a simulation, but it's also suspends reality enough to make for some memorable adventures. It's the ultimate 'what if' game to a combat flight simulation fan and it doesn't waste time bogging you down in the details a typical combat flight sim would find essential.\"\"\"",

The level of details for 3D objects is incredibly high, so when you clinch the trigger to blow things up, they fly apart into hundreds of small pieces. Now the iron birdies with deadly claws and beaks each have a set of unique characteristics. These Death Machines are armed with lethal weapons that the UN has outlawed long ago.

Helicopter duels are both incredibly challenging and engaging, making your palms sweat and your hurt pump the blood-adrenaline mixture all over the body to give you the energy for survival.

In this sense, \"Digital Dreams\" proposes a videogame in which we\u00b4ll feel transported to another world, and even to another dimension. \"Ancient Evil\" constitutes a vehicle to feel we are part of an exciting argument that wraps us as soon as we get into it. The Crypt of the Ancients was built 500 years ago, with the finality of offering a place for rest to the Ancients, who are the supposed creators of the world, and no one, but two exceptions, got to come out of it alive. Alaric, a mysterious and restless man, and one of the two fortunate people that got the mentioned achievement, has converted the crypt in his particular shelter . From there, he challenges the world by offering a reward of 50.000 gold coins to whom can penetrate into the place and coming out alive to tell the carefully kept secret. For centuries, many would-be heroes tried to uncover these secrets with no success, because the powerful spirits living inside the crypt ended the lives of those who try to defy them. To warn the incautious people who feel with strength, capacity and courage to assume the challenge of Alaric, it emerges the spirit of Jetraal the Heroic, who died three centuries ago in mysterious circumstances and was the other one who escaped alive from this restless place. His mission is to warn any person who tries to assume the risk that it is an adventure sentenced to failure in advance, as well as to annul the malicious instincts of Alaric. \"Ancient Evil\" is a 3D role playing game that uses high resolution graphics in a completely interactive environment, which provides it intensity and helps to wrap the player immediately. The people who plays this game introduce themselves into a story of magicians, mystic arts and illusions where there\u00b4s no lack of hand to hand combats and incantations.\u00a0",

Rays of light like thick, lurid fingers appear from the dark of the night. There is a muffled thud followed by a screech of metal that goes right through.

The last fragments that he remembers show an old man with a dirty baseball cap dragging a lifeless body from the crushed wreck of a car. After that, Michael only remembers darkness, gloom and cold. Horrible cold. And the light in the dark. A dazzling, glistening light. A bright spot in the dark that he was attracted to as if by magic. But why? Moaning, Michael gets up and reaches for his forehead. \u201cOdd\u201d, he says to himself, \u201cthere is not even a bump on my head\u201d.

Then, choose the size of the galaxy, the number of species in the game ranging from 3 to 7, and whether you want to play in a peaceful, neutral, or hostile atmosphere. Play begins on your home world where you begin building structures for the purposes of increasing your research,industry and prosperity. As you build these structures you also begin doing research. Eventually your research allows you to build ships for the purpose of space travel. You can equip your ship with a variety of hi-tech gizmos including weapons, shields, engines, power generators, and special function devices. The more your research advances, the more various and powerful your selection of gizmos becomes. As you travel to other solar systems you will encounter alien lifeforms,some friendly, some hostile. You can conduct diplomatic relations with them, exchange knowledge, make alliances or declare war. You expand your empire by either colonizing unoccupied planets or invading planets belonging to your enemies. Finding a peaceful or violent solution to conflict is left up to you. There are several ways to achieve Ascendancy as you will discover on your own.",

The basic idea of the game is to give the player the freedom to explore the big game world on his own without guiding him in any way - and this includes learning the game mechanics as tutorials are neither ingame nor in the manual but as HTML-files on the disc.\u00a0 The travelling with the spaceship is a complex simulation with around 120 key commands. Because there is no time compression available the player should prepare himself to watch the autopilot for 30-60 minutes while going from one place to another. Sometimes the player gets attacked by pirates which he has to fight. When reaching a friendly space station the player disembarks and talks to NPCs (through menus). Earning money can be accomplished by trading goods between stations. Another possible way to spend the time is to land on planets. There the player wanders around and shoots people in first person perspective. There are also multiple vehicles, including flying ones, he can use. Besides the roaming mode there are also single scenarios and a campaign.

	"description": "Battlefield 1942\u00e2: Secret Weapons of WWII, the second expansion pack to the highly acclaimed Battlefield 1942 title, significantly enhances the gaming experience by bringing the most bizarre and deadly weapons from the German and Allied laboratories to the Battlefield. From top secret, cutting edge weapons to secret forces and secret places, a new level of drama and excitement will be added to the Battlefield experience. Many of the new vehicles and weapons featured in Secret Weapons-futuristic for the WWII timeframe-were considered extremely powerful yet experimental. While these armaments and vehicles are rooted in WWII history, many never saw actual combat, however, they are put to use in the game. Secret Weapons lets gamers control and use new weapons and new vehicles in eight fresh WWII combat battlefields including, Telemark, Peenem\u00c3\u00bcende (V2 research facility), Essen and The Eagle's Nest (Hitler's hideaway). All new battlefields offer unique settings from nightfall during the summer in Prague to a winter battle in Norway. Secret Weapons brings the total of playable vehicles in the game to 46. In addition to the 30 vehicles in the original game that includes jeeps, fighter planes, tanks and aircraft carriers, players can operate16 new vehicles including a Horton HO 229 fighter plane that is equipped with a 30 mm machine gun. Other vehicles include a US Sherman tank with a T-34 Calliope (rocket launcher), U.S. Super Heavy Tank, Sturmtiger, Goblin jetfighter, C-47 cargo plane, Armstrong Whitworth AW-52, the German Wasserfall guided anti-air missile and the German Natter rocket plane. In addition to offering innovative weapons and vehicles, the game also improves on gameplay by adding an \"objective based\" mode. In this new mode, players will be tasked with a specific objective to win the battle (e.g. destroy a secret facility).",

	"description": "The award-winning Battlefield franchise invades the high tech frontlines of modern warfare in the new sequel, Battlefield 2. The game brings the intensity and excitement of Battlefield 1942 into the modern era with enhanced team play and the latest, most technologically advanced vehicles and weapons systems available to man. In Battlefield 2, players will choose to fight for one of three military superpowers: the United States, the Chinese, or the newly formed Middle East Coalition. Armed with the latest modern weaponry, players can take control of any of the game's 30+ vehicles to engage in major conflicts with over 100 players in some of the largest online battles on the PC. Additionally, persistent character growth allows players to rise through the ranks and attain the ultimate rank of General. An all-new game engine and physics system brings the modern battlefield to life like never before. The new material penetration feature measures weapons' ability to fire through barriers based on their composition and players will need to know the difference between concealment and cover in order to survive. Battlefield 2 features immense, richly detailed, destructible environments, from city streets to remote forests, in some of the most notorious hot spots around the world. Each map in Battlefield 2 adjusts in scale to support the number of players in the world, providing the ideal vehicle- to-player ratio and an optimised gameplay experience. Enhanced team play features allow players to enter the action on the front lines as part of a formal squad, or work behind the scenes in Commander Mode to direct the strategic assaults of their teammates. Soldier kits now affect vehicles that players utilise on the battlefield. For instance, the medic kit can transform a vehicle into a mobile aid station and the special ops kit can render aircraft undetectable to enemy radar.",

I learned that the first time I wrapped my fingers around the haft of the ritual dagger to demonstrate my devotion to the One that Binds. They had not told me about Him, but there would be many lessons in the weeks to come. Unthinkable lessons. And a name to carry like a thorn in my conscience, a name never to be spoken aloud lest He hear me: Tchernobog. All I've earned by my labor and my sacrifices are more and greater promises. I've carved my soul to shreds in service of the Cabal. What little humanity I retain is corrupted by the Beast, which has grown stronger with every life I've taken. Well, the time has come to sate its appetite and bite the hand that feeds. Vengeance lies at the end of a long, bloody road through the very estates of the damned. Pity only that I have no greater eapon than this old pitchfork with which to still the rustling of leathery wings and douse the gleam of the eyes in the darkness. But I will exact blood for blood from my adversaries and send them back into the shadows between the world of the living and the land of the dead. This I vow.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac Experience the terror. You'll battle cultists, gargoyles, zombies, hellhounds, and an unholy host of other terrors in your quest to stop Tchernobog. You must not only defeat the Cabala you must scour its dread name from human memory. If that means eradicating everyone and everything the Cabal has ever tainted, so be it. Of course, you'll first have to make your way through fortresses, castles, mines, mansions, and estates guarded and kept by Tchernobog's malevolent servants. Fortunately, it is wits that make the hero, and although you're in serious danger of losing yours, you've got enough left to improvise some pretty effective tools of destruction. Aerosol hairspray can be frightening enough on its own, but apply it to a lighter flame and you've got an instant flamethrower (kids, don't try this at home!). Likewise, a flare gun can brighten your prospects considerably against even the grimmest odds, which is to say nothing for shotguns, Tommy guns, and dynamite. Who knows, you may even find that there are some spirits on your side when you find yourself clutching a voodoo doll. \"",

	"description": "Cannon Fodder 2: Once More unto the Breach, also known as Cannon Fodder 2 is an action-strategy shoot 'em up game developed by Sensible Software and published by Virgin Interactive for the Amiga and DOS in November 1994. The game is the sequel to Cannon Fodder, a successful game released for multiple formats in 1993. The game is a combination of action and strategy involving a small number of soldiers battling through a time-travel scenario. The protagonists are heavily outnumbered and easily killed. The player must rely on strategy and heavy secondary weapons to overcome enemies, their vehicles and installations. The game retained the mechanics and gameplay of its predecessor but introduced new levels, settings and graphics. Former journalist Stuart Campbell designed the game's levels, making them harder and more tactically demanding, as well as introducing a multitude of pop culture references in the level titles. The development of the game's plot was hampered by budget constraints and the resulting lack of explanation confused reviewers. Critics enjoyed the gameplay retained from the original Cannon Fodder but were disappointed at the lack of new mechanics or weapons, comparing the game to a data disk. Reviewers praised the game's level design, though less so those of its alien planet. Critics gave Cannon Fodder 2 positive reviews but lower scores than its predecessor and gave mixed criticism of the new theme music and increased difficulty.",

The match engine took at a lot of the focus this edition with the introduction of the \"Gameplan\" 3D match engine, a 3D representation of a football match designed to deliver a richer and more involving game experience. This took CM5's single isometric camera view and provided 11 different angles for the user to watch the match from. Further enhancements were offered as managers were given the chance to deliver their orders from the dugout and actively change the game on the fly. The introduction of the pre-match/half-time team talks that allowed managers to motivate their squad to get the job done. Of course this wasn't the only area to see improvements and revisions. Mangers were provided with different ways to interact with players, ranging from fines, dealing with homesickness and their relationships with other players, in total there were 32 different ways managers could interact with players. But before you could interact with the players, you had to get them. The transfer system was a vital part of any managers repertoire, and Championship Manager 2006 saw improvements made to the system to allow the offloading of unwanted players at the start of the season either by releasing them from contracts or offering them to other clubs. Managers could also explore their options by taking free agent/out of contract players on free trials. Championship Manager 2006 also made revisions to reflect the new rise in rich owners coming in to throw their money around in the Premier League, Club Benefactor was introduced allowing mega-rich owners to come in with a huge cash injection for the club. Of course with great financing came great responsibility and the pressure on the manager to deliver grew ten fold.\u00a0",

	"description": "\"In 1996 myself and other employees at Digital Cafe, a multimedia production house, were approached with an unusual project proposal. Ralston Foods was looking for a simple game that could fit on a CD-ROM which they could distribute in their boxes of Chex cereal. We were very excited at the opportunity to make a game, since Digital Cafe's core business was developing multimedia presentations and websites for various companies. Originally we tossed around some designs which could be built using Macromedia Director, the primary tool our company used for software development. However when we started scoping these designs, we realized that engineering them would take far longer than we were going to be given to complete the game. So we next thought about what proven game engines could be licensed on the cheap. id Software was contacted. They had released Doom over three years before. Since then they had released Quake and were already working on Quake 2. Turned out they were willing to license Doom for a very reasonable amount. Ralston was at first very skeptical that a notoriously violent game such as Doom could be reworked to be rated \"\"E\"\". However a quick demo level proved that the \"\"zorch them back to their own dimension\"\" concept would work yet still retain the fun gameplay of Doom. They were sold and we jumped into it. Being just a freeware promotion, the budget and timeframe were both tight. Thus only five levels were designed and there was little time to even get those few completed. The intro cinematic was made by one animator in his living room. Yet we got it done and it sold LOTS of Chex cereal. Enough that Ralston dug up a few more marketing dollars to fund another five levels. After that the interest died, yet Chex Quest had entertained a lot of kids and even had some dedicated fans. Years later Digital Cafe had ceased to exist and I had moved on to the game industry proper. Even though I have been lucky enough to have been part of teams creating AAA commercial games, I also take pride in having worked on Chex Quest. Many a fellow game artist has called me \"\"old school\"\", knowing I had gotten my start developing a Doom mod. I rarely went back and looked at Chex Quest though, as I was always preoccupied with staying on the cutting edge of game art. That means high-end 3D and certainly not things like 256-color textures and sprite animations. Then around six years ago I got my first email from Mark Quinn, who the Doom modding community knows as Boingo the Clown. He was telling me about his project called the Ultimate Chex Quest. He described an ambitious effort to update our old Doom game to a more modern version of Doom and fill out the remaining 17 or so missing maps with new content. He was extremely polite in asking if I would contribute some new artwork. It was a bit intriguing, but I had a lot going on at the time and declined. However I was quite surprised when I did play his mod. The levels had all been improved yet retained the core experience we had designed. Playing Boingo's mod had sparked my interest in Chex Quest more than anything had in a long time. In the years following I got other emails from fans with similar requests. In late 2007 I found myself with some spare time and started some sketches that would turn out to be the all-new flemoid, the Super Cycloptis. After creating that and seeing how it was received by the fans, I got motivated to make more stuff. Before long I had installed Doombuilder and was making maps. As my first full map started to near completion, I made up my mind to put in the extra time and make a full-blow sequel. I grabbed the source code for ZDoom and downloaded Visual Studio Express Edition and Windows software SDK. I set a goal for myself to compile a geniune Chex3.exe for this mod. In this way I could turn this mod into an exercise in growing my software development skillset as I have never really dug into any sort of C++ programming. Granted opening someone else's project, making changes and recompiling is not hardcore software engineering, but for an artist it was a big step for me. After much trial and error and studying documentation, I finally was able to create the application this mod needed with appropriate changes to flemoids, projectiles, strings and more. This has been a fun and educational experience for me and I hope that you enjoy Chex Quest 3!\"",

Collect orbs for extra points. \u00a0Collect one hundred for an extra life. \u00a0Green orbs are the most common but occasionally you'll come across pink orbs. \u00a0These are worth five of the green ones. There are two types of gun in the demo. \u00a0Blaster gives a concentrated burst of flamey goodness. \u00a0Multiple lets you shoot several shots out at same time in different directions in front of the player. \u00a0There is supposed to be a third weapon though I broke that too so it's not in the demo. The guns can be upgraded a couple of times (their final maximum power stage is not in this demo, neither are smart bombs), and dying will revert the gun's power back down one.",

What really differs this game from almost all RTS-titles of that time is its setting. Game actions take place in World War 2 on the East front. Player can take command over both Russian or German armies with separate campaigns and 14 missions for each side. Another feature of Counter Action is an absence of macromanagement, i.e. there's no building/resource gathering involved in the game. One will only need to control his forces on a battlefield. However, in terms of gameplay CA is still very close to Command & Conquer, with its famous \"tank rush\" tactic. ( MobyGames )",

DTR captures the exact experience of competition, including realistic physics simulation, tuning/upgrading vehicles and progression through various series from hobby stock to the late model class. Possibly the most important feature is the very tight racing. In a field of 16 cars every single car uses the same physics engine with over 100 parameters for each car. This means that all the other cars race right along side you. This results in incredibly tight racing around short circuits, jockeying for position in a pack of vehicles, something never seen before in a game.\u00a0",

Four factions - the Empire, the Mountain Clans, the Undead Hordes and the Legions of the Damned - stand ready for battle as they fight for the survival and dominance over their war-torn world, and the gods they have long believed in. The Mighty Lords watch silently as their Disciples prepare for the daunting tasks ahead. Each warrior must engage in a struggle of swordplay, sorcery, and uncommon courage in order to complete their sacred quests. The Empire fights to secure their people's future; The Mountain Clans search to regain their rune knowledge; The Undead Hordes seek revenge for their accursed god; and The Legions of the Damned battle to resurrect their fallen angel's soul. It is a struggle of desperation. Every stroke of a sword, each blast of fiery magic must be endured beyond exhaustion. For once the clouds of destruction clear, lands will have been transformed, new armies will have been forged and the cheers of the liberated will resound throughout the land. The day of reckoning has come... Only one side shall claim victory. Only the chosen will survive.",

Because Discworld is a fantasy world with a low reality threshold. The real world keeps on breaking through - but Discworld changes it. So you'll find here things that you sort of recognise. Discworld has got photography (tiny imps paint the pictures) and movies (tiny imps paint really fast) and it is even getting its second generation of computers now that the old stone circles don't work fast enough. However, because it is a fantasy world there are some things that it has to have, and one of them is a certain tendency to experience some trouble with dragons. Unfortunately, a dragon is now ravaging Ankh-Morpork, the world's leading city. Many people would consider this falls under the heading of civic improvement, but what Ankh-Morpork needs now is a hero. All it's got, however, is Rincewind the wizard, whose only talent is that he is not in fact dead yet. He also has the Luggage, the nastiest piece of travelware in the Universe.

Driver delivers the clutch-your-seats, adrenaline-charged action of a heart-stopping, Hollywood-style car chase, propelling players along a high-speed, all-out thrill ride through the wild streets of four major U.S. cities. Driver's true-to-life modeling of automobile physics, ultra-realistic environments, cutting-edge graphics and revolutionary replay mode allow users to experience the most elaborate, realistic interactive driving experience imaginable. Assuming the identity of an undercover cop named Tanner, players sell their services as a driver-for-hire to the highest bidder in order to infiltrate a powerful crime ring spanning four of the nation's largest cities - New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami. Extensive pre-production filming of each city brings home an unprecedented level of realism to the interactive arena, where players can clearly pick out such notable landmarks as the Empire State Building, Golden Gate Bridge and South Beach. In addition, each city has working traffic lights, wandering pedestrians who manage to get in the way, moving traffic and vigilant cops on patrol, making getaways more challenging and dynamic, immersing the player into a world that lives life on the edge. Driver comes fully equipped with a revolutionary replay/director mode that gives players all the necessary tools to \"film\" their own car chase. After completing each mission, Driver allows players to go back through a virtual recording of their mind-numbing getaway, reposition camera angles and placements, and even re-cut scenes using editing tools. But a great getaway driver is only as good as his equipment. That's why Driver has a selection of 70's style slam-you-back-into-your-seats raw power, performance-packed, muscle cars. Players experience realistic car handling, complete with damage modeling and true, real-world physics reactions on all cars. The cars lose tires during high-speed cornering and crash and deform when they slam into objects. Further enhancing the white-knuckle experience of Driver is the ability to change views on the fly. Multiple views allow the player to experience the pedal-to-the-metal action from behind the dashboard, where players can look out both side windows for an escape route, or check things out from a third person, behind-the-car perspective",

As players direct troops over the land, they also plunge smaller, hero-led parties below ground to an RPG-modeled world of beasts, battles and bounty. Experience and items gained in this underworld result in great powers and abilities above ground. Using magic, weaponry and skilled maneuvers, players command armies from varying races to control, protect - or destroy - the powerful Heart of Siberys. Obtaining this omnipotent artifact will unleash its full forces, good or evil, upon the entire world.",

On October 8, Henry took off with 6000 men, what was left of his already decimated army, from Harfleur with the intent of marching to his base at Calais. \u00a0A French army of 25,000 under the constable Charles d\u2019Albret began pursuit, finally placing itself in Henry\u2019s way at the village of Agincourt. The Battle: The battlefield was a narrow set of muddy fields bounded by forest. \u00a0To which Henry set up a strong position protected by English longbow men, possibly the most powerful combat force man for man in Europe. \u00a0The French, being forced into the narrow front, were forced to deploy into three sequential lines. Henry moved his men into longbow range of the French, set up defenses of stakes and started firing. The French cavalry plodded forward under the deadly fire. \u00a0They reached Henry\u2019s front lines only to be repulsed when Henry\u2019s archers exchanged bows for axes and swords. \u00a0Again and again they struck against Henry\u2019s lines to be repulsed once more. \u00a0Finally, the French could not take the carnage anymore, and retreated in disarray. Aftermath: The French suffered 7,000 casualties, including d\u2019Albret. \u00a0English losses were about 1600. \u00a0Henry then proceeded to Calais. \u00a0Encouraged by his victory, Henry returned to France two years later to conquer much of Normandy. Scenario Notes: The stakes used by the English archers proved to be quite effective against the French cavalry. \u00a0As such, the English longbow men are given the entrenchment capability.",

Mazrium is the basis for all current technologies and power sources, and also has life-giving properties. It is vital to the survival of the inhabitants of this galaxy. Two days ago, an energy surge on the planet was detected by one of the orbiting mining vessels. The surge originated from within the only remaining Ioxian Citadel (left from the \u00e2Great Uprising\u00e2 two centuries ago). A squad of Cyrops mercenaries was sent in to investigate. The satellite feed that was received indicated something has risen from the ashes and is attempting to regain control of the Mazrium. Moments after their insertion, the Cyrops mercs were destroyed. The Citadel from ages past had snapped to life - reinstating the ion shield that prevents access to the three Mazrium moons and sending the entire galaxy into chaos. No Armada can penetrate the shield; no weapons can disable the Citadel. Strategists believe a single soldier could slip past the defenses which were designed for large scale assaults and shut down the shield's power source from within. The Mazrium must be mined; it is the lifeblood of the galaxy. The Universal Mining Guild has called upon the services of their most ambitious mercenary, Eleena Brynstaarl. In this desperate hour, they are more than willing to meet her demanded price. The planet of Treydan has selected their most impressive warrior to be sent in search of a solution to the dilemma facing the galaxy. Kamchak possesses both the strength and the sheer will that such a mission requires. A hero of the galaxy is in the making. Trapped on one of the Mazrium moons when the Ioxian Citadel kicked on, Dan Blaze wasn't looking for anything but his next load of Mazrium to mine. Now that all his fellow cybernetic miners are dead, he must find a way off of this lifeless world. The only course of action seems to be deeper exploration of the strange Citadel controlling the ion shield. \"",

	"description": "I wrote this program for several reasons. First, I am trying to figure out how Delphi works. Don't laugh. Delphi is powerful and non-trivial. There are a lot of undocumented features. Even the documented ones are sometimes cryptic and non-obvious. I'm making slow progress. Second, I wanted to beta-test Fastgraph for Windows. Somebody needs to keep an eye on Ted and make sure he is writing it right. Third, I wanted to provide a demo program for our Fastgraph/Delphi users, so they can get an idea how to write Windows games. This is perhaps not the most brilliant Windows program ever written, but it's a start. Very likely, you will find better ways to solve some of the problems this program addresses. If so, please tell me. Finally, I was asked to judge a contest sponsored by the x2.ftp.oulu group. \u00a0One of the contest categories is \"best tetris\". I thought tackling tetris programming myself would make me a better judge. So here it is, my version of tetris for Windows. It took me about three weeks to write the program. My understanding of Windows programming and Delphi programming has improved considerably, and hopefully looking at this program will shed some light on the process for you too.",

Lost in the world, they couldn't find them self in the new reality. Living in the Polish city of Szczecin, the two were growing up in a rather unfriendly neighborhood. Mastering martial arts, they found their life tough but very interesting. Until one day a band of thugs attacked them. After a long fight, when Franko was able to see and feel again, he saw a body of his friend, and in his ears he still heard the laughter of the band's leader, Klocek. Now it's time for revenge. Franko is a classical Double Dragon-style action game. With excessive amount of blood and violence, it is suitable for mature audiences only. The player walks right through the streets of a Polish city (decorated with typical decor of the communist era). On his way, he faces various kinds of enemies, from punks, through karatekas, to infamous Communist law enforcement groups like ZOMO. The enemies can be fought with a variety of hand-to-hand blows and moves, though some of them carry guns. ( MobyGames )",

	"description": "\"The game divides itself into three separate, but directly connected, sections: on-field action, coaching playbook, and team management. The game allows players to compete against the computer or head to head against another player and features exhibition, single season, or career/league play. Seasons can be designed in one of five league sizes divided into one or two conferences with up to three divisions each. Seasons culminate with divisional championships, postseason playoffs, and a final Super Bowl-style showdown. Almost every detail of a team's franchise can be customized by the owner: team name, nickname, head coach, jersey colors, stadium type (domed or outdoor), and nearest city. The last two options also have a direct influence on weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and precipitation, which in turn affect field conditions and player performance. Rosters and player management featured 47-man teams, complete with injured reserve, free agent pools, drafting, training camp, and trading. Players are rated from 0 to 99 in eight performance classifications. The game did not include a player editor however the gaming community had several shareware applications and utilities available for download that allowed players to edit the players themselves, or download unofficial, user-created rosters. In career leagues, potential and actual ratings could be affected by such factors as training, injuries, and aging. This added a depth of realism not seen before. The game recorded more than 300 statistical categories that could be displayed onscreen or printed. Detailed box scores were available during and after games, as well as match-ups from the previous week. League leader stats compare all teams and players in the league in a wide range of categories. The game also featured a playbook editor. More than 200 stock plays were included with the game and were divided among standard offensive and defensive formations. Utilizing a point-and-click drawing interface, you can easily alter any of these pre designed plays or create your own. The on-field/arcade play featured three skill levels that offered full or partial control of the action and coaching duties. The game supported keyboard, mouse, and dual joysticks. Your view of the action could be changed to one of nine fixed camera positions. These views, as well as a free-floating camera, also contribute to the game's extraordinary instant-replay system. Using standard VCR-style controls, you can easily view, edit, and save pivotal plays as a highlight film. (Wikipedia)\"",

	"description": "Hacknoid is based on the traditional games where you control a paddle, and try to bounce the ball to break bricks on the screen. \u00a0The Hacknoid difference lies primarily in its award-winning 3D playfield design! The goal of Hacknoid is simple - to complete all the levels of the game. \u00a0In order to complete each level, you need to destroy all the bricks on that level. \u00a0The bricks are the \"blocks\" which appear in two levels - one just above the midpoint of the screen, and the other on the top of the screen.\u00a0 In order to destroy the bricks, you primarily use your ball. \u00a0You start the game initially with 5 balls (possibly less if you have continued the game), and use them one at a time. \u00a0To make the ball appear on the paddle, press the left mouse button. \u00a0Press the button again the release the ball and begin that level (the ball will eventually leave your paddle on its own if you wait too long). \u00a0The ball will bounce off the bricks above you, breaking them in the process. \u00a0It also bounces off the ceiling and the four walls of the playing field. \u00a0When it comes back to the bottom, move your paddle underneath it to bounce the ball back up again. \u00a0If you don't contact the ball with your paddle, it will be lost, and you need to start with another ball. Although the paddle appears flat, it actually has a rounded shape, and therefore can rebound the ball in different directions depending on where it hits the paddle. \u00a0 Bricks also get older and decay as you play a level. \u00a0If you take too long, the bricks will fall away on their own. \u00a0You get no points or credit for those bricks, so it is better to try to break them all yourself. \u00a0Some top-level bricks, when they are broken, will release bonus items. \u00a0Pick these items up to get extra power or points. \u00a0But watch out - there are some one that you won't want to pick up!\u00a0",

	"description": "In Pursuit of Greed was completed in '96 and my second published commercial product. By this time, Channel 7 had morphed into a corporation called Mind Shear Software. At peak, we had 5 full time developers and a number of contractors. Greed was written in C and Assembly and based on the Raven Engine (also used in Shadowcaster, and similar to Rise of the Triad's engine) by Id. This engine was roughly between Wolfenstein and Doom tech-wise. I added many additional features such as transparency, sky box, fixed bugs with sloping floors and ceilings, etc. I also wrote tools for level editing. The graphics were pre-rendered from 3D Studio Max. The player's goal is to collect various artifacts to reach a required level of value. There are secondary artifacts as well but the primary is required to complete a level. Raven Engine Notes (from id): \u00a0 \"Right now, the engine supports a bi-quadrilateral projection scheme (ala\u00a0 \u00a0 Wolfenstein) but with some notable exceptions: \u00a0 First, the engine supports lighting in the form of distance shading \u00a0 (i.e. it get darker the farther away one goes in the z direction) for\u00a0 \u00a0 an added effect of depth. \u00a0In the future, we will add localize lighting \u00a0 so that certain rooms can be darker than others and a torch can light up \u00a0 the surrounding areas (ala Doom). \u00a0 Second, we have the ability to move along the y-axis and can create the \u00a0 effect of bobbing up and down as we walk, jumping, falling down, etc. \u00a0 Third, our floors and ceilings are texture-mapped adding even more to the \u00a0 visual detail. \u00a0We will probably put in some detail options including\u00a0 \u00a0 shutting off floor and ceiling texturing to support slower machines. \u00a0We \u00a0 can even shut off the ceiling and provide and scrolling skyline. \u00a0 Fourth, the engine supports 8 rotation views for any object or sprite \u00a0 (ala Doom). \u00a0 Lastly, (not shown in demo) our ceiling and floor tile support morphing for \u00a0 realistic contours. \u00a0In simpler terms, we can make some ceilings higher\u00a0 \u00a0 than others and the adjacent tiles will stretch and morph to make a smooth \u00a0 transitional surface. \u00a0We can thus create cavernous rooms with huge\u00a0 \u00a0 monsters.\" Music for In Pursuit of Greed was also written by Andrew Sega. We own all rights to the game and the music. Some critics say the music was better than the game. Unfortunately, I tend to agree. =P",

The real Treasure of the Incas - our knowledge - I have hidden it away in a safe place.

People have always fought across new frontiers and as man colonized the galaxy nothing was different, conflict was inevitable. I-War drops the player into the middle of this conflict giving them full control over a 150 meter long Dreadnaught class corvette - the destiny of mankind lies with their actions. Quite simply I-War (PC CD-ROM) is the most advanced and technically accomplished space sim ever created. Although I-War fits the mold of the classic space-sim there\u2019s much more to it. The game demands logical puzzle solving, imagination, flair, bravery and cunning as well as mean dog fighting skills. I-War allows the player to take any of four roles, switching at any time during a game. As captain, the player will take the ship into battle against enemy fleets in hostile skies. As pilot, the player will weave through oncoming fire - taking the ship right into the heart of the action. As gunner, the player will launch missiles against multiple targets and fire upon enemy ships - and finally as Engineer, the player will have to sort out the damage done to the ship. I-War is uncompromisingly realistic, using real physical models to create the gaming universe ensures complete immersion in the gaming environment. The plot develops via stunning fmv sequences, as would be expected in a space sim. What you wouldn\u2019t expect is the dramatic quality of these scenes and the seamless way in which they propel the gameplay forward. But it isn\u2019t just the plot and cut scenes in I-War that give it it\u2019s awe-inspiring looks. The in-game graphics are simply astounding with real time action that is truly\u00a0 cinematic. Individually, the team behind I-War are responsible for creating some of the most cutting edge interactive entertainment ever. Now they have got together to form Sheffield based, Particle Systems and they have produced yet another benchmark product in the shape of I-War.",

Not so with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Games that capture the action, excitement, and special effects of the greatest Indy movie of them all. And Indy the game character has all the style, wit, and resourcefulness that make the big lug so lovable in the movie. Too much for one game. One game can't do Indy justice. So we designed two very different game experiences: Indy the Action Game, and Indy the Graphic Adventure. And in both cases, it seems that Nazi Germany has just declared war on the Jones boys. Red hot, slam-bam action. Indy the Action Game delivers classic arcade thrills on a hell-bent chase for the greatest treasure in history - the Holy Grail. As Indy, you'll use your whip, your fists, and your wits. Escaping grave-robbing cutthroats. Pulverizing Gestapo goons. And surviving the lethal trials of the Grail Temple itself. How's your I.Q.? In Indy the Graphic Adventure, you'll find out if you can keep up with the guy with the whip and the hat. Maybe you'll make the same decisions Indy made in the movie. Or score higher I.Q. (Indy Quotient) points by finding subtle or ingenious alternatives. All the while exploring a stunning world of sights, sounds and characters - many of which you didn't see in the film. Use Lucasfilms' acclaimed - and enhanced - point 'n' click interface to toss off a sarcastic one-liner, sweet talk your way out of a tight squeeze, or just haul off and slug the sucker. And thumb through Henry Jones' 64-page Grail Diary for precious and fascinating clues. We made a spectacle of ourselves. Both games bring you the great graphics, exciting camera angles, and stirring sound tracks that made the Indiana Jones films so special. Of course, our development team had the advantage of working with the people who made the movie. And that's how we made sure that when you step into Indy's shoes, your feet are planted firmly in the fire. \"",

The Evolved, on the other hand, were not about to scurry, rat-like, into the depths of the subterranean haven. They decided to brave the harsh conditions of the once fertile planet.

Nah. On second thought, imagine you're Leisure Suit Larry. The most popular nerd in the history of computer gaming is back. This time he's won a two week vacation at a wacky, Toon-toned resort, filled with heartachingly realistic babes.

Like the city setting of Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, the island has several areas and is fully-explorable at the game's start. The controls feature a mouse-based interface and a text parser for directing the Larry's actions. Littered throughout the resort are Larry's potential mates; whenever the player interacts with these women, they are featured in a close-up portrait, once again echoing earlier games in the series. The basic structure of the game involves Larry presenting each woman with gifts, although none of these items require money to obtain, unlike in the original Leisure Suit Larry. Leisure Suit Larry III features a second playable character, the titular \"\"Passionate Patti\"\", whom the player briefly assumes control over. Patty's portion of the game is much the same as Larry's, including multiple 'death' scenes and a detailed character portrait of her love interest, a male stripper. However, the Patti sequences are more reminiscent of traditional adventure games, requiring players to navigate through a maze, as well as collect items for use in later puzzles. (Wikipedia)\"",

Reminiscent of Sega's own Baku Baku, if you get five in a row, you dump marbles on your opponent (either a living, breathing person or the computer), hindering his progress. The game provides several levels (from beginner to expert) that vary in the number of marbles in your starting screen but with no noticeable increase in speed. There is also a practice mode, where you can pit yourself against the clock, as you get up to speed on the game. The game is divided into five levels and each level has five rounds.\u00a0",

	"description": "You are playing around with a metel detector in your backyard, when you pick up a signal. After digging for a while, you find a large metal box. You find inside; a note and a rock. The note reads: Dear Gerfy Flertmunder (thats you!) My name is The Ancient, and I have been kidnapped by an evil creature called The Enforcer. The Enforcer is a vicious creature that I have only read about. It's very big and very powerful. I was kidnapped about 2000 years before you were born... so your year is about 1999. After you rescued me, I got in my time machine, went into the future to your yesterday, and planted this note. Now you have to go back in time to rescue me so that the whole paradox works out. Please hurry! -The Ancient (Printed on recycled paper) You look at the rock. There is a little red jewel on it. You touch it and instantly, you get this kind of fuzzy feeling, like your in a dream. Then things start changing around you, until you find yourself in what looks like a forest. Man, oh man you sure did it this time! That was LOST 1. After completing several tasks, you were able to find the next magic rock in the Ancients house. The rock transported you into the middle of a desert island. The desert island is one of four islands that make up the Lost Islands. All you have to do is find the Enforcers turf, rescue the Ancient and convince him to return you to your own time. Simple.",

	"description": "Luna Ticks is an action-strategy game from Brisbane-based Terraform Software Systems which redefines a few game boundaries! This game is set on various moons where you have purchased a mining franchise from the MegaBucks Corp., who owns this moon. They don\u2019t care how you go about paying off your establishment loan, but pay you must! You can\u2019t holler for the sheriff if your opponents start to play dirty, so you have to write your own rulebook as you go... Each of the moons is composed of different materials, but to you they\u2019re all just ore. In your Tick - that\u2019s your mining vehicle - you mine the ore using Cutter Orbs and then process the Orb contents in your factory to make either loan repayments or other useful items, such as defense installations, weapons or Tick performance enhancements. Your opponents will not hesitate to steal or destroy your manufactured items, and you too, if they can! The race is on to see who can pay off their loan first, then discover and access the wormhole out of this moon which appears only after the first player reaches that stage. To suggest that the normal ethics of mining might be a little bent is an understatement... The complete version of Luna Ticks allows for single-player games, with \"Robo-Ticks\" as opponents - up to the full complement of 8 players, or two-player games using a Serial connection (modem or cable), or full network games using the standard IPX protocol. In any game, Robo-Ticks may be used to fill empty player slots, and these are provided in several play-strategy types. The shareware version of Luna Ticks does not include the IPX network play, and has fewer moons. The even smaller internet version available here does not include Serial play, and has only two moons. The fluid and, er, unorthodox nature of the gameplay changes with player\u2019s input. Changing your game strategies will result in an immediate reaction from your opponents. Competing with Robo-Ticks in a single-player game can be a big challenge, but nothing compares in perversity with playing other human players! For this reason the Serial and Network play modes of Luna Ticks really offer a completely different game. Forget about re-writing the rulebook - you\u2019ll need to throw it away! Is this the high-flying job for you? Can you be a Major Miner - or just a Minor Miner? (Morris Minors need not apply)",

In this \u00a0battle, \u00a0the \u00a0Earthlings \u00a0are \u00a0on \u00a0the \u00a0side \u00a0of \u00a0the humanoid, \u00a0mighty \u00a0and \u00a0ancient race - Kerkops. \u00a0The Kerkopian race has long been the leader \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0cosmic \u00a0war \u00a0with \u00a0the inhumanoid enemies- the Krakins. \u00a0The Krakins' single goal: To conquer all galaxies and to fully \u00a0destroy \u00a0any \u00a0other \u00a0living form, \u00a0independent \u00a0developing \u00a0in \u00a0the infinite Great Cosmos. Having know about the new unification of the \u00a0Earthlings \u00a0with the \u00a0Kerkopians- the Krakins sent a special Space Destroyer to Earth which, \u00a0with one powerful sweep put an end to the young, although \u00a0quickly \u00a0developing \u00a0race. \u00a0The \u00a0attempt \u00a0to capture Krakin's spaceship does not end successfully. \u00a0However, thanks to \u00a0the \u00a0help \u00a0of \u00a0Kerkop, \u00a0the \u00a0Earthlings \u00a0are successful in obtaining \u00a0autonomy \u00a0and \u00a0 are \u00a0 capable \u00a0 of \u00a0 self-improving cybernetics \u00a0device - cyborgs who are capable of thinking like humans named Proteus. \u00a0A few of the \u00a0Proteuses \u00a0were \u00a0sent \u00a0to catch \u00a0the aggressor's spaceship which, as it turns out in the end is not a typical battle ship, but rather an entire factory which \u00a0specializes \u00a0in \u00a0the \u00a0production \u00a0of \u00a0Krakin's \u00a0clones. Furthermore, \u00a0the size of this space destroyer \u00a0is \u00a0comparable with small planets or huge asteroids. The game consists of two parts. In the first part of the game, \u00a0it is \u00a0necessary \u00a0for \u00a0you \u00a0to successfully \u00a0carry out a battle in the close proximity to the enemy's huge \u00a0spaceship. \u00a0You \u00a0fly \u00a0to \u00a0meet \u00a0the \u00a0aggressor's spaceship \u00a0on \u00a0a \u00a0fixed \u00a0trajectory- although you should shoot them from your on-board weapons. \u00a0In the case that \u00a0you \u00a0don't succeed, \u00a0 all \u00a0that \u00a0you'll \u00a0see, \u00a0your \u00a0spaceship, \u00a0will \u00a0be destroyed into tiny little pieces. \u00a0After having \u00a0successfully shooting \u00a0the enemy you go inside the enemy's ship, \u00a0where the second part of the game begins.

The main layout of the screen is changed but otherwise the game remains the same. Select Quick Start to use the default settings or settings from a previous game. There is a Practice Mode and an in-game Help System that teaches you about the game of golf in general as well as how this game is played. Microsoft Golf 2.0 comes with two courses: Torrey Pines and Firestone South. The game also offers compatibility with the Links 386 Pro courses (available separately). Microsoft's \"PlayerNet\" is used as the avenue for multiplayer golf. Each person must have PlayerNet and the game installed on their system to play. (MobyGames)",

But watch out - the enemy's escorts have just sighted you. You're the hunter - but suddenly - you've become the hunted! As Commander, you must sink their ships and keep your submarine from being destroyed - if you can. Will you select a quiet patrol sector in the Marianas Islands or choose the dangerous waters off the coast of Japan? Is a submerged daylight periscope attack best or do you charge in on the surface at night using only radar bearings to guide you? Do you fire a spread of your precious torpedoes or can you close the range and pick off the enemy with a single torpedoe shot? These decisions and many more are yours to make as you take your place among the elite ranks of the SILENT SERVICE! It's exciting - and it's fun. It's another great Micro Prose simulation - and it's called SILENT SERVICE. Look for it now on your dealer's shelves. \"",

Swearing a revenge on treacherous neighbours, Mirko gathers his faithful warriors, leading them to conquer all surrounding territories. Polanie is a real-time strategy game similar to Warcraft. There's only one non-linear campaign (25 missions) and the enemies use the same unit types. The only resource in the game is milk: everything - from buildings through defensive walls, bridges to new units - is built using a certain amount of it. The milk is produced by cows, which graze the grassland around your village. When they eat enough, the cows will return to their barns and the milk will be added to your resources. Woodcutters are needed to complete buildings (\"bought\" with milk), they double as axemen in combat. The early medieval setting is spiced up with a touch of magic: your men (enemies too!) may heal themselves at sacred places scattered around the map, priests and priestesses may call fire from the sky. Creatures of magic or nature may provide help or nuisance. Large warrior teams can be selected and controlled as a group. ( MobyGames )",

International convlicts eased as world affairs fell increasingly under the control of the United Nations, a powerful alliance that embraced all nations. And most of all, technology blossomed, offering prosperity and comfort to advanced countries, and promise to developing ones. Before long, however the leadership of the powerful U.N. would be tested. As the second decade of the century commenced, the same surge in technology that had offered so much hope began to signal doom as it demanded a higher price than the world was able to pay. Fuel demands began to outsrip available supplies. Across the globe, despite decades of talk of cheap and clean alternative fuels, industry, transportation, even everday life leaned heavily upon the fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Eventually the world could not avoid a terrifying realization: reserves were far leaner than even the most conservative exerts had predicted. With devastatinf swiftness, an energy crisis of unprecedented severity struck. The world entered a state of panic. The energy industry reeled. Small companies collapsed, merged, or were taken over: corruption spread: andthe crisis worsened. With no relief in sight, the U.N. made a dramatic move: it shut down all energy companies, hand-picked four of the world's shrewdest business minds, and turned the industry over to them. The resulitng megacorporations -- acting on the most urgent U.N. mandate of the modern era -- became known as the PowerHouses. Now, the year is 2020. The four PowerHouses share a mission -- to supply a power-starved world with energy -- but each operates in fierce competition with the other, and each dreams of a day when the world;s entire energy infastructure falls under the control of one.\u00a0",

But, the fact is that machines have turned on humans. The greater human population is now a drone collective of computer-mesmerized zombies. A few outsiders have escaped the spell of the Network. They've formed an underground resistance; operating out of abandoned buildings and traveling at night to avoid detection by the machines. They have survived for some time, but they cannot defeat the Network by themselves. This alliance of dissidents needs help from an outsider.

These rebels have also discovered a way to send the control program through a time loop to the recent past-the late 20th Century. The Video Mail message crackles through pirate channels and hits your computer with an electronic charge. The dissidents have found you. They need you to use their hacked-out program to drive a killing machine through their war-torn world and liberate the people from computer control. When you engage the program, you take command over the Battle Force Tank (BFT), a fast, powerful and versatile war machine.

	"description": "\"The Year is 2132. Deep space exploration and colonization have become reality. The human race is growing at an incredible rate; man's sphere of influence has been expanding unchallenged for 150 years. Man's universe has split into 2 distinct societies, the highly structured and lawful core worlds and the lawless frontier worlds. The Core Worlds represent the best that humanity has to offer; a peaceful application of technology used for the betterment of mankind. The Frontier Worlds hold the seamy underbelly that the Core Worlds want to forget; a greedy race for the elements the Core Worlds need for expansion. Huge mining and manufacturing corporations compete in the pillage of the outer worlds purely for the generation of profit. To maintain basic order on the outer worlds and to compete with rival companies each corporation maintains a private force for problem solving. It was in 2102 when these private forces reached the level of companies and fleets that the Core Navy stepped in at Tarnok IV. The Raw Materials division of Ford Toyota Co. wanted Tarnok IV for the vast minerals that could be stripped from the planet, while Universal Pharmaceuticals saw the planet for its industrial and crop potential. The legal ownership of the planet had been in dispute for more than twenty years so the Sato Group decided to take the planet by force and dedicated 75% of their forces to do so. Universal Pharmaceuticals also sent in their own force. As the first shots began to be fired, the 142nd Battle Fleet, commanded by Rear Admiral Davies, came out of HyperSpace. The Core Navies ships came out with their plasma cannons hot, and torpedoes locked. Without warning the ships opened fire. When the first barrage was over, they had destroyed over three quarters of the ships from both companies. Admiral Davies then demanded a cease fire from all parties. His orders had been given days before when it was decided that such a precedent as mass fleet battles by corporations to decide planetary ownership could not be set. The repercussions of this were that the percentage of total employees of a corporation dedicated to security could not exceed 1%. Furthermore the corporations were only allowed to hire mercenaries if they did not employ their own security force, and even then they were restricted in the number that could be hired. Because of these restrictions it became necessary for the corporation to hire or employ heavily armored individuals. They needed to be able to send in one man where they had previously dedicated a thousand. Therefore each of these individuals needed to be a one man army. With enough fire power that they would not need to depend upon reinforcements, or help in any way. The Planet Runner was developed specifically for this purpose. The Planet Runner could navigate over most terrain while carrying the fire power of a light armored division, and the defense strength of a small battle ship. A modified corvette class starship provided the living quarters for the one or two man crew, and a highly functional and adaptable computer that could also strip down and rebuild any Planet Runner operating out of the corvette. The back half of the corvette was dedicated to storing parts, and repairing and building Planet Runners. While these one man armies could pacify small towns and uprisings single handily, the Core Worlds do not see them as a threat and allow their existence. You play the role of a freelance mercenary on a limited protection contract with a large mining corporation. You operate a Planet Runner used for deep recon missions and planetary pacification. You patrol a section near the edge of known space which is frequently plagued by pirates and subject to frequent raids. At the start of the game a mining camp on Lanios 3 (a planet under your jurisdiction) has stopped following the usual communication protocols. You are called in to investigate. The corporation is quite certain that an extensive pirate raid is occurring on the surface of Lanios 3, there were numerous disturbances reported just prior to the loss of contact. As per standard defense protocol you have been given free reign to react to any threat. \"",

This game is VERY unfinished (given that I have had around a week only to come up with a fresh and original QB mini-game!), and since I personally believe that __REAL GOOD__ games take time and effort, I'll finish it up ANYTIME after the 2002 Gaming Gold Mini-Game Compo is over. So far, the game features only ONE level, and there is NO story to this game yet (since this is a VERY unfinished version, after all!).

	"description": "Game Notes ---------- You are now looking at the first playable preview of Star Fighter for the PC! This game was designed to take advantage of a Pentium processor [The programmers at Krisalis hand-coded each line in assembly from the original 3DO version]. To see the true power of the graphics engine, try it out on a P133 or better with a PCI graphics card. \u00a0Of course, Star Fighter supports all ranges of machines down to a 486, but nothing can beat the experience of flying around and destroying massive chains of buildings in hi-res 640x480 at 24 frames per second. \u00a0Just compare Star Fighter against the competition to see the superior graphics quality in hi-resolution. If you own a 486, Star Fighter will run extremely fast in low-resolution mode, plus we will soon be supporting Creative Labs' 3D Blaster! History ------- If you are at all familiar with the 3DO version of Star Fighter, you will notice right away that the PC edition bears as little resemblance to its predecessor as it did to the Archimedes classic. \u00a0For one, the game engine now utilizes a natural fogging technique to bring terrain into view without pop-up. \u00a0We have also added realistic textures to every object among the 8 planet types, ranging from photographic quality grass, water, ice, and rock to steel and glass skyscrapers. \u00a0All 60 maps have been updated and all fighter craft enhanced with additional polygon and texture detail. Best of all, we have retained the same playability that made the original game so great. \u00a0A few logical loopholes have been closed here and there, and the mission objectives have been tweaked to provide an extremely challenging game with plenty of hidden features. \u00a0Hunting for crystal combinations is now more convenient with the addition of a ship-board analytical computer, and an altimeter makes cockpit control easier for flight simulator enthusiasts.",

Soon they owned small countries and corporate influence was felt at the highest level of world government. Then, a European corporation perfected the CHIP. Inserted in the neck, the CHIP stimulated the brain stem to alter your every perception of the outside world. Better than any drug, the CHIP gave hope to millions by numbing their senses to the misery and squalor around them. The CHIP was a technological revolution and sold countless units with the slogan \"Why change your world when you can change your mind\". It also left the user open to auto-suggestion, and gave the corporations the perfect tool for manipulating the populace. Soon the corporations were at war among themselves, desperate to monopolize CHIP manufacture. It wasn't long before the Syndicates became the controlling force all over the globe. As a young executive in a small European Syndicate, you're looking to make your mark. You observe from a control platform in an airship high above the teeming city streets as your agents, controlled by CHIP technology, spread the shadow of your terror. Each mission takes place among the canyons of concrete and steel, the mazes of streets and sewers, that our cities have become. The population goes about its business, moving among the traffic, commuting on trains, rushing to and from work, unaware of the violence about to explode around them. There are over 50 named missions for you to choose between, but before you choose one, you need to develop an overall strategy for world domination. Tactical considerations vital to the ascendancy of your Syndicate include the of an adequate mission Budget, the skills and experience built up in the Cryo Chamber of potential agents, and developing your own maneuvering skills. A Syndicate executive must be a master of strategy, assessing a mission environment and planning agent moves. An executive must also have the reflexes of a steroid-addicted sprinter and a remorseless lust for power to commit acts of gross violence -- but sleep soundly at night.",

It was no use; even with the lights on the bridge darkened the night was too dark to make anything out visually. Captain Samuel Jenkins came forward, removed his hat and mopped his brow. \"\"Hot night, admiral,\"\" he said, \"\"and dark as the inside of a dog. I know destroyers Fletcher and Cushing are in line ahead of us, but I sure as hell can't see 'em, and we don't dare run any lights.\"\" \"\"Guess we'll just have to depend on that newfangled radar contraption,\"\" Gray replied, but he nonetheless resumed peering through the binoculars. The Exec appeared near Captain Jenkins's elbow. \"\"Radar contact, sir, bearing 340, range about 8,000 yards. A big ship, or several small ones - the radarman isn't sure which.\"\" Jenkins was suspicious. \"\"Is he sure this isn't just some kind of reflection from our lead destroyers?\"\" \"\"Pretty sure, sir.\"\" \"\"Then see if fire control radar can pick up a target.\"\" Admiral Gray picked up the TBS microphone. \"\"Attention all ships. We have a possible enemy contact, bearing 340, range 8,000 yards. Increase speed to 24 knots and execute a column left turn to course 270. All guns bear starboard. Fire on my command only.\"\" There was a flurry of activity on the bridge as the orders went out and sailors donned their helmets and life vests. One by one the cruiser's main battery turrets rotated to the right until they were locked in the direction of the presumed target. The Exec returned. \"\"Sir, we've lost them! Their radar image merged with the reflection from the island. They could be....\"\" From ahead of the Atlanta came the flash and deafening roar of an explosion. As Gray watched in horror, the destroyer USS Cushing lifted out of the water and fell back in two pieces. \"\"Torpedoes!\"\" Gray yelled. \"\"Turn hard to starboard or they'll hit us broadside!\"\" The sailor at the helm spun the wheel as the oncoming wakes became visible in the light of the burning ship. Captain Jenkins held his breath as the deadly Long Lance torpedoes hummed past, but Admiral Gray was wasting no time. \"\"All destroyers!\"\" he barked into the microphone, \"\"fire starshells to illuminate the area to starboard. All guns may fire as soon as you have a confirmed enemy target.\"\" An enemy searchlight stabbed out and struck the Fletcher, lighting her up so every detail could be seen for miles. Immediately, shells started falling around the destroyer, and her own guns opened up in reply. The Atlanta's gun director swiveled around and locked on the source of the searchlight, and almost every turret she had lined up with it. When all the main battery lights blinked \"\"ready,\"\" the gunnery officer struck the button labeled \"\"fire\"\" and the ship shook as twelve guns let off in a single spasm. \"\"Hits!\"\" cried the lookouts, \"\"We got at least three hits on the first volley!\"\" \"\"Rapid fire,\"\" ordered the gunnery officer, and the Atlanta's guns, now zeroed in on the target, began firing as fast they could reload. The enemy ship snapped off its searchlight, but several starshells burst in the air above it and it could be clearly seen as a Japanese light cruiser, Nagara class. Columns of water from near misses erupted around her, but many shells were going home, and fires were breaking out in her superstructure. Within minutes she was a floating wreck, down by the stern and sinking. \"\"Cease fire,\"\" Gray said, \"\"we've won!\"\" He turned to Captain Jenkins to congratulate him on the performance of his crew, then stopped - for beyond him to port he could see the after half of the Cushing, still afloat and burning fitfully. \"\"Come about and prepare to pick up survivors,\"\" he said.

	"description": "\u00a0If you're new to TechnoVenture, it is an arcade-style puzzle solving side-scrolling adventure game. This version was written for 32-bit systems supporting DirectX. If you've seen the DOS version of TechnoVenture this version should be more stable, more enjoyable and more flexible. TechnoVenture now has music and much better sound effects. You can also drag the game window and the inventory to suitable positions fitting your preference, and resize and make other adjustments to the game window. The only drawback is that, if you don't have a suitable system (I believe any 486/66 MHz system or better with at least 1 MB of video memory that supports DirectX would be suitable), TechnoVenture 2.0 may run incredibly slow on your system. However, if you have a good system, it appears to me that the DirectX version *could* run faster than the DOS version (which is too fast anyway if you have a good system). Currently, this version of TechnoVenture is also completely compatible with the DOS version and uses the exact same \"maps\" or \"worlds\". There is one minor compatibility problem with the DOS version though. Recording a demo in one version of TechnoVenture and playing it back in another may not work as expected if the player interacted with moving objects (especially platforms). It is possible, however, that the demo will play acceptably, and as a matter of fact, the demo that was distributed with the DOS version does work with the new version.\u00a0 There are a few main points of attraction in TechnoVenture. First of all, TechnoVenture has plot. Unlike many games where you run around shooting mindlessly at anything that moves, TechnoVenture involves the player more in events that are happening and presents puzzles to solve and can develop a plot through text messages. The player can talk to people, read signs and make observations about the environment. Second, TechnoVenture supports custom level creation. When you receive TechnoVenture, you receive a number of \"maps\" which are like pieces of the game. These were created for distribution with the game. But that's not the end. Others can develop their own pieces to the game and add to it! If you register TechnoVenture at the developer level (see \"Registration\"), you too can develop your own pieces to the game and make those pieces available to everyone else who owns TechnoVenture via the TechnoVenture homepage (http://members.aol.com/BlueMonkMN/TechnoVenture.html). Finally, for worried parents out there having trouble finding suitable games that don't involve \"blood and gore\", I tried to reduce violence in TechnoVenture to almost nothing while still keeping the game enjoyable. I didn't want to spend the extra effort to draw all that anyway :).",

	"description": "I remember when I was a little kid at the age of 7. Back then I used to think that the games we played on the computer was great, but they could be better. When I started programming in Qbasic my goal was to create my own platform game - like Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario. The Adventurers is made to prove that you don't need a language like C++ to make a quality game. QuickBasic can still do more than many think. Our goal were to create the best game ever made in QuickBasic. Well the game still doesn't have music, but we think there are plenty of fun and excitement in the game. A lot of people see Wetspot II as being the greatest - but when I saw ECG's Spinball, I knew QB had potentials. That's why I consider that game as being the greatest. Now in 1999 the standard has moved from Stick fighter to the fantastic 3D fighter SFB2. Wetspot II may still be the greatest Maze game ever - but not the best all-around game! Among other platform games there is 'Peanut Patrol'. This game features a nice idea, but the combination of slow graphics together with poor gameplay makes it something that I wouldn't play. Then my favourite JumP. That game really shows potential, but the gameplay could have been done better. The gameplay in The Adventures has been improved since the demo release, I think it's the best yet. All the levels in the game was made using 'The Level Creator'. To get this tool, go to our web site. But remember, don't publish your levels as being the official ones. You may not publish the whole game either. And remember. We could have chosen not to publish the source code. We believe that you will not steal ANY of it.",

America needed a hero to inspire us in the fight against Nazi tyranny\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20acand it got one! His name was Steve Rogers, but the world knew him as the star-spangled sentinel of liberty, Captain America! Now, rocket ahead twenty-two years to 1963, when a shy high-school student was bitten by a radioactive spider. His name was Peter Parker, but he gained world-wide fame as the wall-crawling, web-swinging, wise-cracking Amazing Spider-Man! Since those early days, these death-defying national icons, Captain America and Spider-Man, have become two of the most exciting and admired superheroes of all. Comicbooks have evolved rapidly during the last fifty years, from the comicbook itself, to cartoons, television series, full-length motion pictures, and finally to entertainment software for the home computer. At the same time, the audience for the comicbook heroes has grown by leaps and bounds. Just think, when Captain America first appeared in the late '30s, computers didn't even exist! Even in the early '60s, when Spidey exploded upon the scene, computers as we know them were still in their infancy! But the times they are a'changin'! Today, in the high-tech world of 1989, the computer has become an indispensable tool for education, finance, communication, correspondence, and of course\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20acentertainment. The entertainment software industry is burgeoning as new and more innovative concepts are created daily, and more and more computers are introduced into the home. Always on the cutting edge of the future, mighty Marvel Comics is proud to join this new, exciting field of entertainment software with SPIDER-MAN AND CAPTAIN AMERICA IN DR. DOOM'S REVENGE, a challenging and sophisticated new game developed by Paragon Software Corporation. Just think! An original Marvel comic book sets the stage for the incredible adventure to follow. The game itself becomes an interactive comicbook, continuing where the original illustrated saga ends! So instead of just reading a comicbook panel, you can control the fate of Spidey and Cap as they face some of the most spine-tingling, challenging arcade sequences ever created! You will help your two colorful Super-Heroes in their life-and-death struggle against some of the most powerful and destructive Super-Villains of all, including Batroc, Machete, The Hobgoblin, Oddball and other equally fearsome foes! You'll discover full-screen color graphics, lightning-fast animation and awesomely realistic sound as you face one of the most challenging and thrill-packed games ever created. Best of all, with the development of this first interactive comicbook adventure, the entire Super-Hero concept has taken a giant step forward. Just imagine battling shoulder-to-shoulder with Spidey and Cap as you actually participate in adventures that, up till now, you were only able to read about! So, dare to accept the challenge of a lifetime and join forces with your bullpen buddies and Paragon Software as we prepare to take the Marvel Comics Universe into the Twenty-First Century! Think of the wonderment that lies ahead!\"",

The peaceful kingdom which thou dost see before thee wast not always this way. The fields are stained with the blood of valiant men and women who gave their lives to purge the land of tyrants, evil souls, and wicked sins. Syree, like its sister kingdoms which also inhabit the land of Sheol Garrett and Zoar is a magnet for those who wouldst crave unrighteous power. It wasn't until King Emara took the throne that the land finally knew a lasting peace, freed from the petty wars of neighboring kingdoms which sought to expand their domain. Over time, conflicts didst come again to Syree, but the kingdom stood tall and proud, unconquerable by the minions of evil. One day, though, a terrible war raged across the land. The people rallied behind their banner, ready again to defend king and country. The battles were fierce, and many fell. The dark prince was strong. Stronger than any foe who had come before him. Then suddenly, the unthinkable happened . . . Syree fell. Rancit now sat upon the throne as king. Strong wast his hand, and evil. He ruled with a hammer and vice, and the people groaned under him. Hope, though, never waned. For prophecy foretold that the line of Emara did not die in that fateful day, but lived on! And that if the true and rightful king could be found, he wouldst dispatch the evil tyrant who stole the kingdom and oppressed the land. Quietly, the search began. Ever careful were the people, for Rancit had ears everywhere. Long was the quest, and treacherous indeed. But the king wast eventually found. And he, who wast but a child himself, dispatched Rancit with a thrust of the tyrant's own sword. Telbor now sat on the throne of his forefathers. Relieved from the oppression of the wicked king, the land again blossomed under righteous rule. But evil continues to live on in the world we occupy. Twice now, since Telbor assumed the throne, hast dark forces attempted to come to Syree. The first such manifestation wast of an Evil Wizard who assumed control of the kingdom of Garrett. The tale of his rise to power and his eventual destruction is chronicled in The Kingdom of Syree I. Not long after the Evil Wizard's defeat did a new threat come to the land. This time, the Keeper of the Power did die, and it was up to the forces of Good to find the new Keeper before Evil could. The heroic struggle of the people, and Telbor's Lord Champion who eventually found the child, is told in The Kingdom of Syree II: Black Magic. Today, the new Keeper is established, and all is peaceful. Syree continues to be ruled by the good King Telbor, whilst Zoar enjoys the guiding hand of Ashad and his queen Mirlan. The once proud kingdom of Garrett, sadly, is still without a king and continues to suffer. Perhaps one day someone shalt rise up to claim the throne of Dakar. Until then, Garrett remains uneasy, caught in the middle of a fractional war between three lords who claim right of ascension. For now, though, countryside travel is safe. Enjoy thy visit to the land of Sheol and the kingdom of Syree. Adventure doth await!",

In The Space Bar, you\u2019ll play Alias Node, a cop on a hardscrabble mining planet, Armpit VI.

Designed and produced by two professional game developers who openly acknowledge Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, The War In Heaven was created to provide an exciting alternative to the spiritually dark and blood-drenched games that are so popular today among teenage and adult gamers. Personal choice is the defining feature of the game. The story is set at the time of Lucifer's rebellion against God. The player takes the role of an angel and decides whether to obediently serve the Almighty as one of the Divine Host, or to join the rebellion and fight in the legions of the Fallen. Each of The War in Heaven's 12 levels incorporates a distinct Biblical lesson relating to the consequences of following the Divine path of Obedience or the Fallen path of Knowledge. Important spiritual truths such as Fear Of The Lord and Righteousness are revealed in between furious battles with the angels of the opposing side. The game features a state-of-the-art, non-Euclidean, portal-based engine and 14 distinct types of angels, 7 Fallen, 7 Divine. Divine angels are armed with five weapons to bear against the Foe, while the Fallen are equipped with five different weapons with which to wreak havoc upon the forces of Heaven. The path of Obedience is hard, but true, and while there are rewards to be found upon the Fallen path of Knowledge, evil ultimately demands its own reward.",

As your mission advances, you will uncover a larger and more sinister conspiracy, where the fate of the world hangs in the balance. And unlike other games, if you make a mistake, you're gone - because in the real world, one shot counts. To carry out a mission, the player plays \"Six,\" the leader of the team, and must assemble a crack team from a pool of skilled specialists and plan the operation using an overhead three-dimensional model of the target area. Once satisfied with their strategy, the player then leads the assault using a first- or third-person (you can toggle between the two) three-dimensional view. The game will be playable by single players with artificial intelligence controlling friendly and enemy troops, or by multiple players across the internet in both collaborative and head-to-head modes. Each mission consists of two distinct phases: the planning phase and the action phase. In the planning phase, the player receives a briefing and is given all available intelligence regarding the missions. The player then selects appropriate team members, equips them, and plans the mission. Rainbow Six creates the best of both strategy and action game play. The action play is team oriented - perfect for Internet play. With 20 playable characters and 17 different missions in real world locations, the variety of gameplay is extensive. So carefully select your team and even more carefully, conceive your plan. Because it's time to go save the world. One mission at a time.",

	"description": "Rainbow Six is back...and tougher than ever. Due to the team's fantastic success with defusing major terrorist incidents, the international community has come to depend on RAINBOW as the main force secretly protecting citizens world-wide. Thus, the story continues in Rogue Spear with the team's initial missions being business as usual: a hostage situation at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an airplane hijacking. However, the team soon discovers that these crisis situations are actually related to the nefarious plots of not one, but two antagonists--the Russian Mafia and a Middle Eastern terrorist organization--groups who have, until now, been able to escape the jaws of international justice. Through a series of increasingly difficult missions, RAINBOW uncovers the terrorists' deadly master plan, just in the nick of time--to save the world again. Players will have new weapons at their disposal as well as sniper specialists to properly take out deadly foes from afar, and with over 400 new motion capture moves, terrorists and hostages will react even more realistically to you and your team. The frozen breaths of team members will be seen puffing from their mouths in snowy conditions while footprints are left behind. Guide your team with a joystick, add more terrorists with the mission editor, and send your friends a copy of your greatest attack with the cinematic replay feature. All of this and more will make Rogue Spear the greatest action/strategy game you\u00e2ve ever played. Just remember one thing: if you fail, the game isn\u00e2t over\u00e2\u00a6the world is.",

But the evil demon Baalhathrok has taken them and so the player controls Treeac to retrieve them. In an isometric view, Treeac has to conquer the seven floors of Baalhathrok's tower. The player controls a ball with his mouse and clicks where Treeac should go. Fights are initiated with left clicking on the enemy, for other actions the right mouse button has to be hold while choosing a symbol on the bottom of the screen. Besides of fighting the enemies the player has to open several doors - either by finding the key, pressing the right buttons in the right order or using one of his four lockpicks. When using the lockpicks the player has to beat a mini game where he has to make the correct mouse movements.\u00a0 When searching the rooms of the dungeon there are various potions, herbs and magical pieces of equipment to be found. With the herbs the player can mix potions or spells, which are available in four categories: Attacking, defending, transforming and item manipulation. There is no free save system, there are special save points during the game. Every time he wants to save the player has to sacrifice one piece of equipment. \u00a0( MobyGames )",

	"description": "\"Once upon a time in a far away castle in a magical land lived the sorcerer Divinius and his two apprentices, Hokus and Pokus. These two were little rascals who were always causing trouble, much to the annoyance of Divinius. For example, when he thought they were learning their spells, they would be off in the orchard eating all the cherries meant for Divinius' favorite fruit pie. Divinius despaired of them ever learning anything of use. One day, Hokus and Pokus swapped the lids around in the larder and poor Divinius put Marmite on his shoes instead of polish. This caused Divinius to reach the end of his tether. He sent Hokus and Pokus down to the storeroom to clear it out. No one had tidied up that room for a few centuries (Divinius was actually rather lazy himself), and he was hoping that this daunting task would keep those fools out of mischief for a good few days. As he send them down the steps, he commanded them not to touch anything. Unknown to Divinius, his apprentices had slipped their comic collection into their robes and did not intend to labor at all for a few hours. After some time went by, the dim-witted apprentices realized it was nearly suppertime and they hadn't done a stroke of work yet. They decided to shift some of the boxes around to make it appear as if they had actually been doing something. They'd just reached the second pile of boxes when, out of reach and covered in cobwebs, they saw a box with the word \"\"WARNING!\"\" in bright red written across it. Like bees to a honeypot they hurridely cleared everything away and carefully dragged it out where they could see it better. The box read: \"\"WARNING! Instant magical Troddlers - Just add water. May turn into zombified variety if allowed to teleport. DO NOT TOUCH!\"\" This, of course, sounded highly intriguing to the naughty duo who instantly decided they ought to investigate further. Unknown to them, Divinius had been plotting behind their backs. He was so fed up with their pranks that he decided to try and make some Troddlers (small, artificially created men) so they could one day replace Hokus and Pokus. Naturally, their first thought was \"\"I wonder whether we could get some of these Troddlers to clear up for us whilst we maybe have a little snooze!\"\" They were both in such a rush to be the first to get at the Troddlers that they ripped the box and spilled Troddlers powder in their clearning bucket. There were bubbles, ripples, and then splashes and jets of water as the powder turned into Troddlers who burst out of the bucket and all over the floor. There were hundreds of them. The Troddlers, who apparently have animal-like minds, instinctively began walking toward a teleporter (which appeared to be a little door) at the far end of the storeroom as if they were hypnotized. Hokus and Pokus had no idea what to do. Just as the last Troddler was walking through the teleporter, Divinius stormed in. Not even he could believe what these stooges had done this time. He was so angry that he couldn't even muster words for a moment. After a tense moment, he forced the words out: \"\"Go after them right this instant and get back as many as you can!!\"\" Hokus and Pokus were each given an almighty kick up the bottom and they headed toward the teleporter at an alarmingly fast rate. As they shot through the door, Divinius shrieked: \"\"And don't bring back any bleedin' zombies!!\"\"\"",

	"description": "Maxis, well known for its SimCity games, has unleashed a DOS simulation game of a different breed. Unnatural Selection focuses on genetic engineering, letting you design and breed creatures in a militaristic scenario. In the Maxis tradition of unique scientific experimentation with powerful user control over variables, the Unnatural Selection genetic breeding lab is equipped with a sophisticated computer called DigiLife AL-2000, which aids you in creating the monsters of war. These creatures, called Theroids, are not particularly intelligent but are strong, fast, and violent. There are three types of Theroids: Zips, which are fast; Slugs, which slime around displaying their endurance and stamina; and Hulks, which are very strong and, as you might guess, green in color. You breed and raise these Theroids in the experimental breeding lab, controlling their physical attributes, fighting behavior, and mating urges. In addition, environmental settings, such as amount and type of food, level of genetic mutation permitted, and available cage space, give you even more control over the lab. The laboratory has a science fiction feel to it with its plethora of buttons, dials, tubes, and other devices, most of which provide information in a female voice. As in most Maxis games, the main menu provides two choices: experimental mode and actual game playing. You can breed strong creatures in the experimental mode by eliminating weaker and virus-infected Theroids. The engineered creatures are saved in a file and later included in a game. The game mode first displays a limited movie of the game's premise. A cast of characters, plot, and both written and verbal material reveal the tired futuristic war story: How can we get rid of mistakenly bred creatures by using other genetically superior engineered creatures? The unwanted creatures have been left on an island (of your choosing), and you must conquer the existing dangerous creatures with similarly dangerous creatures of your own making. Different views let you display the beasts \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2 by looking down into their pens and up close at their faces. The screen animation that shows the close-up views of the creatures is amusing and entertaining. Although I was warned about the violence of this game, the Theroids are so colorful, noisy, and silly looking that I couldn't take them seriously even when they were ripping each other's heads off. Such movies as Jurassic Park seem much more horrifying than the antics of these cartoonish beasts. You may feel quite powerful while controlling this gadget infested lab, but the game gets old rather quickly. With so many controls and variables, Unnatural Selection is also confusing to figure out. The users' manual is only somewhat helpful. In an effort to be sharp and witty, Maxis left out a few important details",

It is the sequel to DreamForge's 1996 release War Wind. The storyline of War Wind II involves the discovery of one of the tablets of Naga'Rom in the north pole of earth. A military/scientific station is located at the site of the tablets recovery. The tablet is inadvertently activated by the scientists and the facility, transporting all occupants of the facility and much of the surrounding ice to Yavaun. Meanwhile on Yavaun, the Eaggra have escaped Tha'Roon rule and have allied themselves with the Shami'li, forming a faction called S.U.N. (Servants Under Naga'Rom). The Tha'Roon have retained their rule over the Obblinox and the Tha'Roon empire's mission is clear: Destroy the S.U.N. Faction and rule Yavaun. As the Tha'Roon come close to victory, a sudden burst of light and a new race emerge on Yavaun, Humans. The Tha'Roon turn their attention to the new invaders and the S.U.N. slip away to regroup. The game begins years into the conflict between all the inhabitants of Yavaun. The humans have splintered into two groups or factions. The Marines (Children of the Soldiers of the facility), whose goal is to conquer the other races and rule yavuan and the Descendants (Children of the Scientists) who seek to return to Earth. The game plots for each faction varies dramatically. The Tha'Roon seek to destroy all other races, while the Marines have a similar goal. The Descendants want to simply return to earth. The S.U.N.'s objective is the most peculiar as they want to free the Obblinox, unite with the Descendants, and create peace on Yavaun. (Wikipedia)\"",

Create a hero in one of nine races and then take him and his armies through campaigns, quests and multiplayer games. The nine races include: humans, dwarfs, orcs, minotaurs, undead, high elf, dark elf, wood elf, and barbarian. Hero's Command Radius Your hero and his armies must set out, on either a path of good or a path of evil, to destroy the Two Tears (two powerful and mystical meteorites) before they fall into the wrong hands. As you win scenarios, campaigns or multiplayer games and your hero gains experience he will be able to choose a specialty class that will strengthen his attributes. The four broad classes include warrior, priest, thief, and wizard. Your hero becomes an extension of you, the gameplayer, because of the time you'll invest to create and develop the hero. Warlords Battlecry brings a Dungeons and Dragons/RPG aspect to the RTS genre. Your hero continues to develop over time, no matter the type of game you play. Your heroes' characteristics are retained between scenarios, campaigns and multiplayer games. In addition you can carry armies, with your hero, between any two scenarios. Not only does the hero involve you to a greater extent in gameplay; he also affects gameplay through his command radius. The command radius is a specified area around the hero. When the hero gains bonuses he can pass these on to any of his armies within his command radius, making his armies more powerful.

	"description": "Developed in ancient times as a means of controlling a population too great to be supported by the limited resources and technology available. Participants in these events were revered like the GODS of war they became. All too often though, they were forced into these events as the only means available to support their families. If they survived, it was only a temporary reprieve from what must be considered a determined fate of continual participation till death. Each team in these War Tournaments would play under the direction of a highly skilled warlord. It was the warlords strategic ability that would ultimately determine the outcome for his team. These events were eventually discontinued, deemed unnecessary by governments, even though they were shown to be effective and very popular with the spectators. The year is now 2999 AD and WarTorn, as it is now known, is set for a revival. The people of the world are understandably nervous, and yet uncomfortably excited by the prospect of controlled war. There hasn't been a major conflict of any significance for centuries, and all the other sports have become so mundane that they have been relegated to very niche markets. The world was just screaming out for a little spice to break the boredom. Humans need conflict and that's a fact. If you're not involved in conflict, then you sure as hell want someone else's to look at. WarTorn has fantastic prize packages on offer so the response from would be Warlords and others, destined to be cannon fodder, has been extreme, to say the least. Anyone can fit the role of a natural born killer, given the right encouragement, but the teams do have to be selective. After all if your not winning, the sponsors will not be happy and may pull out. You have to pass psychological examination from the team shrink. This will also determine you responsibility within the team. Only those with the most brilliant and twisted minds become Warlords. Competition for this position is fierce, and a fair amount of off field skullduggery has been taking place. The rules have changed little, since ancient times, as far as can be accurately determined anyway. The technology used for combat is restricted by tournament themes, with the initial theme having been determined by a populous vote, to be 20th century, a nostalgic era to be sure. The PSS (Public Sports Service) has bought the rights to televise the events worldwide. Massive war arenas have been built worldwide in preparation for the start of the first season, commencing on new years day 3000 AD. The controlling body FIWA has strict guidelines on all aspects of WarTorn. For example, the arenas must be at least 2 kilometers square and scalable using the official \"Terra Tech\" arena modifier, up to 10 kilometers square. They can be of any topographical composition, with no limit placed on the type and number of hazards contained. All arenas are inspected by FIWA official and certified to support up to a given number of teams in any one tournament. The number of suitable base areas and amount of resources deposited in the arena are the main guides for the rating given. Designers, the guidelines say, should always keep in mind that WarTorn is a controlled spectator war sport and as such, the layout of the arena should be conducive to great battles and great television. The Teams warlord may select from a package of endorsed 20th century weaponry replica components. The tools for on field manufacture and modification of are supplied through FIWA, along with an initial quantity of resources, to be used for the establishment of a base. During the course of a tournament, resources are to be mined with pre-fabricated extraction buildings. Raw resources are included in the arena design and are utilized by the teams to provide ongoing materials for the war effort. An efficient design in the layout of a base is considered to be a prime element in determining the outcome of a tournament. A free trade system operates during the course of a tournament, whereby the warlord can exchange raw or processed materials for finished war machines and troops offered by other warlords. The tournament referee may also offer other items up to stimulate the war spectacle if this is deemed necessary.",

Lots of people will emerge with countless different strategies, but the basic strategy is that you must protect your worms whilst causing as much pain to the other team(s) as possible.

A FOLLOW-UP GAME TO THE AWARD-WINNING X-COM:UFO DEFENSE also known as UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN in Europe, XCOM: TERROR FROM THE DEEP will give gamers a chance to experience alien terror from a new dimension-the depths of the earth's oceans-in X-COM: TERROR FROM THE DEEP. Awakened by the cosmic emissions of their brothers, the vast chambers of innumerable species begin their re-animation cycle. X-Com must face a new terror, an army of aliens that are already here, but in an environment more deadly than deep space. The aliens of the depths are well prepared to take on man in all the oceans, even bringing the war onto the land. Enter into combat in a strange and alien world, use new technology to enable the war to be taken to the enemies. Arm your troops for an encounter the likes of which man has only dreamed of in his worst nightmares.... A vast sleeping enemy has awoken. When the colonization vessel T'leth crash landed on Earth some sixty five million years ago the emergency systems placed the aliens in suspended animation. A distress call was sent but never received by the alien's homeworld. Over the eons the computers have awoken small groups of aliens to attempt a colonisation, but the strategies and devices have been imperfect. They have also been sinking ships over the centuries, to plunder their cargoes and recover gold - the base metal in the hyper-alloy Zrbite. X-Com: Terror From the Deep utilizes the familiar UFO control system, multiple menus and tactical icon bar. Terror however expands and refines all aspects of the system - the new UFOpedia is more structured and incorporates a clear and more concise database. The tactical section utilises multiple colour palettes and animations to conjure the atmosphere of the deeps but still retains the familiar turn-based combat system. The new audio system utilized in X-Com: Terror From the Deep creates a true other world ambience and alien atmosphere. Featuring twice as many tactical sites and 10 times the level of animation, Terror From the Deep expands the UFO engine into a believable aquatic reality. The alien strategy comes in two distinct parts. The first is to set up various bases in strategic locations around the globe that manage to control the majority of the seas. The second, and most dangerous, part of their plan is to recover the necessary artefacts that will allow the alien races to energise the core of T'leth and awaken the Great Dreamer, the ultimate alien whose darkness will engulf the globe. As the leader of X-Com, you will have to counter these aliens with new technology: weapons for aquatic warfare, submarines, and floating bases around the world. As you encounter alien vessels as they race through the seas, recover advanced alien technology and battle strange sea dwelling creatures. The span of the alien strategy is based around a series of deep sea bases from which they launch attacks and recover artefacts. These range from small complexes, through large complexes, ancient cities, strange unnatural formations, to the immense colonisation ship, T'leth, the ultimate goal. X-Com will be faced with reprisals and its bases will be attacked by the aquatic aliens during the course of the game. X-Com: Terror From the Deep also features several new effects some of which include: water effects (giving colouration of objects), multi-level tactical maps featuring exciting depth effects, new alien life forms with new technologies and weaponry, new missions - surface missions, on board ships, in ports and on islands, classical cities, coral constructions, sunken ship wrecks, upwardly spiralling bubble effects from breathing apparatus, gas powered weapons leaving wakes as they tear through the water, alien bases have entrances (rather than jumping directly into the base. Find the entrance to enter the alien lair.) and a new alien encyclopaedia full of new watery denizens and mutation technology.\"",
