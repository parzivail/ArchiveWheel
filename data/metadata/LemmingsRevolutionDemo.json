	  "One more puzzle to challenge their tiny little brains... after years of risking life and limb, the Lemmings' migration to find their utopia was over. The Lemmings had found their promised land snd made themselves at home. Some took shelter in the forests, and some by the ocean, while others settled in the desert. \n\nLittle did the lemmings know that their adventures had become stuff of legend, and had attracted popular intrest among the weasals. One dark night, every lemming was captured and packed away into boxes while the weasels set to work! The only means of escape is their hot air ballons. Unfortunately these have been stragicly positioned to lure the lemmings into danger.\n\nLead the Lemmings to safety in this addicting puzzle\/strategy game!"
