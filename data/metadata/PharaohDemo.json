	  "We've included three missions in this demo, the first two of which are set in the \"Pre-dynastic Period\" of ancient Egypt, and are very similar to the first two missions of the full game.  The third mission, however, is set in the \"Archaic Period\", and has been created especially for the demo.  \n\nIn this demo, and in the third mission in particular, we've tried to include as many features from the full game as possible, without allowing it to become too unwieldy or difficult to absorb.  Nevertheless, if you have not played any of our city building games before, you may find the third mission a bit overwhelming, as many concepts are introduced in a relatively short period of time.  That's just because this game has so much to offer, and we didn't want to leave anything out!  Rest assured that in the full version of the game, each and every fundamental game concept is introduced gradually, over several missions (throughout the whole game, in fact) with plenty of guidance, feedback and help. \n\nIn the third mission, your ultimate goal is to build a mud-brick 'mastaba' tomb.  If you are an experienced Caesar 3 player, you may want to go directly to the \"Archaic Period\", where you can dive right into the this mission (though you will still miss some cool stuff in the first two missions)."
