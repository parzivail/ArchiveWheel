	  "Design and build the biggest, best and scariest rides ever seen in any theme park. Create over 50 designs from the traditional 'Wooden Rollercoaster' to the high-tech 'Steel Corkscrew' and the terrifying 'Reverse Freefall' - all featuring accurately simulated motion dynamics. Fund the research and you'll get the greatest rides current technology is capable of then charge the top prices to your visitors.\n\nBut it's not just about building rollercoasters - you've got to look after all your guests including the less adventurous by providing the complete range of 'family' ride entertainment such as miniature railways, boat hire and mazes. Build food and drink stalls with rest facilities; hire costumed entertainers for the kiddies and create a park landscape that's not only fun but also appealing to walk through. Remember, you can own the best rollercoaster ride ever but, if the visitors don't have a decent path to get there, you'll get no takers and no profit.\n\nSuccess is not just a matter of building state-of-the-art rides; it's how you structure the park with themes, colours and landscaping that will help your guests enjoy the experience enough to come back and pay for more.\n\nRollerCoaster Tycoon gives you the UPS, but also the DOWNS: why should people come to your park? Are the rides too expensive? Have you built enough food stalls? Do your amazing rides have a habit of breaking down too often? Climb or fall, boom or bust, you're in charge of it all: making sure the rides are safe, finding out what your guests are thinking and giving them what they want - for the right price!"
