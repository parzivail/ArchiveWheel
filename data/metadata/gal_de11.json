	  "<div>With an advanced form of artificial life technology, Galapagos is the first game to present a character who literally has an independent mind. The artificial Mendel has the ability to learn, adapt, and interact with the environment and the user. You must help Mendel navigate through challenging obstacles and escape from beautiful but hazardous 3D, texture-mapped worlds, which are viewed through the eyes of a camera. As Mendel moves through the world, the camera follows with sweeping, cinematic movement. You activate objects near Mendel by clicking on them, affecting the environment in different ways. By doing so, you can coax this creature to solve the many puzzles that lie in its path. Of course, Mendel is an independent thinker and may have other ideas. Galapagos is a single-player game with a third-person perspective.<\/div>"
