	  "<div>\u00a0This interactive demo of Dragons in the Mist allows you to play 50 turns of the TARAWA scenario. The full version of Dragons in the Mist comes with seven scenarios (including TARAWA) and a complete scenario generator including American, Australian, British, Chinese, Dutch, Japanese and Soviet forces.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>\u00a0The demo does not need to be installed to your hard drive - it can be played directly from the CD-ROM. To start the game, run the program file \"Dragons\" - located in the same directory\/folder as this readme file. If you do want to install the game to your hard drive, just copy the files directly from the CD-ROM.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>\u00a0To get the action moving quickly, the Demo begins \"in-progress\" on turn 10 of the standard Tarawa Beach scenario. You command the invading US force, attacking against the computer-controlled Japanese on the island. As the game begins the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines are wading ashore on Red Beach 1. The 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines will begin arriving at Red Beach 3 on turn 13 or 14.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>\u00a0Your objective is to completely occupy the island. Which, given its small size, essentially means you will have to wipe out the entire Japanese force. Historically, the Marines achieved this objective - but only after a fierce battle and with severe casualties.<\/div>"
