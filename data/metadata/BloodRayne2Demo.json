	  "Rayne\u2019s Most Personal Battle Yet\u2026.\nWhen we last saw Rayne in 1935, she joined forces with the shadowy Brimstone Society to destroy a supernatural Nazi bid for dominance. Her father, Kagan, an influential Nazi collaborator, was killed in an accident at the close of the War. Cheated of killing Kagan herself, Rayne has spent the last sixty years ferreting out and destroying his many offspring, her siblings. They have banded together and formed the Cult of Kagan, pledging to carry on his legacy of creating a new era of vampire supremacy where humans are mere cattle for the bloodthirsty predators that hunt them. Rayne\u2019s nefarious siblings have created \u201cThe Shroud,\u201d a mysterious substance which, when released, renders the sun\u2019s lethal rays harmless to vampires and twists nature into a nightmarish perversion. Now only Rayne stands between an unsuspecting humanity and a horrifying vampire dawn.\n\nAbout the Demo\nThis demo will give you a hint of the scope promised in the full version. Rayne earns new abilities, fighting combos and additional gun modes as the game progresses. This demo only features one gun mode and three special powers but we think there's enough adrenaline-pumping action to give you an idea of what to expect in the full version.  \n\nDemo Features\nThis demo features 1 level of play--the Mansion. Your objective is to discover who is the Cult of Kagan and put an end to their ring leader, Dariel Zerenski."
