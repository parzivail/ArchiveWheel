	  "<div>VoRTeX is a brand new board game of strategy and chance in which several game pieces are raced through a spiral path to a common finish. VoRTeX is easy to learn and on-line help guides you through any questions you might have.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>VoRTeX combines simple geometric shapes to provide endless hours of fun for all ages. This game develops strategic thinking, improves shape, pattern and color recognition for children and is thought-provoking for adults. The distance of the moves is decided by the throw of a computer die. The choice of which piece to move is determined by the players so that their pieces advance more rapidly than the pieces of their rivals.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>VoRTeX can be played by 1, 2, 3, or 4 players. You may also include the computer to play one or more positions. A demo option is also included to quickly familiarize you to this game.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>You may choose the board-shape (a square or circle), board-size (small, medium or large), no. of game-pieces (1,2,3 or 4), play-level (novice, intermediate or expert). Other options include animation speed, color of game pieces and tracks.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The ease and rapidity of playing VoRTeX ranges from that of Tic-Tac-Toe to a chess game. Depending on the options that you choose a game of VoRTeX can be over in less than a minute or last as long as thirty minutes.<\/div>"
