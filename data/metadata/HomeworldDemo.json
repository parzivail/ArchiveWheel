	  "Homeworld's epic tale begins in the far reaches of the universe. You were the benign lords of a peaceful society located in the center of a lush spiral galaxy. For as long as anyone could remember, no one challenged your peaceful existence. But then came the conquerors, invading with the sole purpose of overtaking your world. Billions died, and the survivors were relocated to a cold, lifeless planet on the edge of the galaxy. Hundreds of years later, all knowledge of your previous existence has been lost. Only vague myths remain, until the discovery of an ancient tablet buried within the ruins of a half-destroyed craft in the great banded desert. This Guidestone reawakened knowledge of your ancestry, and set your race on the path home - coordinates leading straight into the heart of the galaxy. Sixty years ago, construction began on the giant Mothership that will carry millions of your people into deep space. Construction is now complete. Your journey to the Homeworld begins here...\nReal-time strategy is one of the most exciting and entertaining genres of gaming. These titles bring together the thrill of watching troops charge into battle on your order and the intensity of managing the conflict from high above the battlefield with the precision of a chess grandmaster. Now, for the first time, comes a game that brings heart-stopping 3D warfare to the vastness of space. Homeworld is the next evolution of real-time strategy gaming, delivering a fresh experience in a totally 3D universe. Homeworld gives players a new level of freedom to create new styles of gameplay while simultaneously delivering cinematic quality graphics, stunning special effects, brilliantly rendered ships and an innovative interface."
