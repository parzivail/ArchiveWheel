Developed in association with Johnny Herbert - British GP champion and veteran - Grand Prix World Champions pledges to deliver unsurpassed realism plus the thrill and excitement of the most preeminent world racing event ever, Formula 1.\n\nGrand Prix World Champions was developed in collaboration with Formula 1 race car driver and champion, Johnny Herbert. Herbert who has tested and approved the game for its realism said, \"Grand Prix is the truest Formula 1 sim he has ever played.\" Herbert's contributions, stunning 3D graphics, force feedback support, superb sound, and for the first time in auto racing sims, unique chrome mapping, has resulted in an authentic feel and look to this new racing challenge.\n\nIn true Formula 1 style, gamers will tour the world on 15 actual tracks (from Argentina to Belgium), on the fastest racing machine in the world.
