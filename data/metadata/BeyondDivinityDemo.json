	  "You are a servant of the Divine - scourge of necromancers and sorcerers alike. Your purpose in life is to fight all that is evil using any means possible. Your dilemma\u00e2\u00a6 during an intense battle with one of the great necromancers, a demon drags you into its universe. There you are soul-forged with a Death-knight. You are cursed and destined to spend the rest of eternity bonded to this creature of evil.\n\nOr maybe not...\n\nThe Death-knight dislikes the soul forging as much as you do and together you embark on a great adventure. You both have a common goal - to undo the soul forging. You and your unlikely companion quickly figure out that the only way to rid this curse is if you unlock the secret of riftrunning \u00e2 an ancient art that allowed the prison universe\u00e2s indigenous population to travel between universes.\n\nYour quest is set: To become a Riftrunner!"
