	  "<div>I wrote this program for several reasons. First, I am trying to figure<\/div><div>out how Delphi works. Don't laugh. Delphi is powerful and<\/div><div>non-trivial. There are a lot of undocumented features. Even the<\/div><div>documented ones are sometimes cryptic and non-obvious. I'm making<\/div><div>slow progress.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Second, I wanted to beta-test Fastgraph for Windows. Somebody needs to<\/div><div>keep an eye on Ted and make sure he is writing it right.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Third, I wanted to provide a demo program for our Fastgraph\/Delphi<\/div><div>users, so they can get an idea how to write Windows games. This is<\/div><div>perhaps not the most brilliant Windows program ever written, but it's<\/div><div>a start. Very likely, you will find better ways to solve some of the<\/div><div>problems this program addresses. If so, please tell me.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Finally, I was asked to judge a contest sponsored by the x2.ftp.oulu<\/div><div>group. \u00a0One of the contest categories is \"best tetris\". I thought<\/div><div>tackling tetris programming myself would make me a better judge.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>So here it is, my version of tetris for Windows. It took me about<\/div><div>three weeks to write the program. My understanding of Windows<\/div><div>programming and Delphi programming has improved considerably, and<\/div><div>hopefully looking at this program will shed some light on the process<\/div><div>for you too.<\/div>"
