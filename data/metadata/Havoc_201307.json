	  "<div>Here begins the new millenium. Obsolete national borders were eliminated long ago, giving way to strange New Worlds within the old. Toothless governments and their crippled armies made way for lean preditors: the Corporate Entities. Megalithic companies now compete for territory and the wealth of nations in an ongoing battle of their best trained warriors. Outfitted with state-of-the-art combat vehicles, corporate sponsored professionals, vile mercenaries, and foolhardy newcomers contend for the spoils of victory.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Scattered across the broken continents exist prized territories. Among these are three most coveted by the global overlords who fight for control of uncounted bounty-the Badlands, Fallout Wasteland, and the Tyrakian Territories. For years, these three regions have been dominated by a single conglomerate named Tyrakian Global. Tyrakian's strategic thrust has been investment in \"gateways\" capable of teleporting forces quickly between diverse challenges to their empire. However, the battle lines have evolved. The inevitable break up of the largest corporation in history has created a void of power leaving these lands accessible and available to anyone with the guts to try their skills and stake a claim. The keys to strategic gateways are rumored to be found abandoned like the terrain itself, as Tyrakian Global has struggled with its own collapse. The question of conquest remains simple: Do you have what it takes to fight in a world of HAVOC?\u00a0<\/div>"
