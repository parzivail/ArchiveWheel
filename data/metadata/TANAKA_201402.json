	  "<div><br \/><\/div><div>Tanaka is a 3D race game where \"pilots\" guide their<\/div><div>crafts (vehicles) through the streets of the City\u00a0<\/div><div>of Tanaka in the year 2525.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The \"missions\" vary in difficulty and objective.\u00a0<\/div><div>Some races are run \"against the clock,\" while others<\/div><div>are \"Duels\" or \"Total Carnage\" races where you must\u00a0<\/div><div>defeat the other pilots or destroy them to emerge\u00a0<\/div><div>victorious. And last but not least, is the \"escort\"<\/div><div>mission where you must guide another vehicle through<\/div><div>the streets, defending and protecting it from all<\/div><div>others, until it reaches safety (the finish line).\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Upon completion of the race, a \"pilot\" is awarded\u00a0<\/div><div>prize money if they finish in the top three spots.<\/div><div>The higher the finish, the greater the award. The<\/div><div>awards can then be spent in the \"Shop\" where pilots<\/div><div>purchase and equip their vehicles.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The vehicles are \"smart\" and highly configurable.\u00a0<\/div><div>Pilots are able to choose from among many different\u00a0<\/div><div>variables such as different type of cars (Stormy X1,\u00a0<\/div><div>Flying Fish, Bomber F20 etc.), engines (hydrogen,\u00a0<\/div><div>plasma, or nuclear etc.), missiles and mines\u00a0<\/div><div>(rolling mine, ZZ rocket, the Seeker etc.) lasers<\/div><div>(double laser, multi-laser etc.), and shields<\/div><div>(deflectors).\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>However, as mentioned above, it should also be<\/div><div>noted that the vehicles are \"smart\". Which means\u00a0<\/div><div>that when you buy weapons, you also need to\u00a0<\/div><div>consider \"weight\" and \"drag\" on the vehicle etc.,<\/div><div>as well as cost. The more your car weighs, the\u00a0<\/div><div>slower it will go.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>As you fire your weapons and the car \"lightens\",<\/div><div>it will go faster because it is lighter. A skilled<\/div><div>pilot will know how to choose wisely, balancing\u00a0<\/div><div>weaponry and performance when constructing their<\/div><div>vehicles.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Tanaka is a true 3D game with digital stereo sound<\/div><div>and force feedback joystick support. \u00a0It also\u00a0<\/div><div>features a network component that allows up to 8<\/div><div>players, to compete against each other, over the\u00a0<\/div><div>Internet (this feature not available in the demo).<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>The following features are \"crippled\" or have been<\/div><div>removed in this demo release version:<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Contains only 3 levels<\/div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - All networking features disabled<\/div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Custom screen game play disabled<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>These features are present and working in the retail<\/div><div>release version.<\/div>"
