	  "Welcome soldier. We hope you're ready for battle. Our problem lies here in Tunisia. It seems the Libyans have used recent political tensions and civil unrest in the area to support their Islamic movement, as a result, rebels in the area have joined forces with the Libyans and are now moving north through Tunisia. Obviously, we're greatly concerned that the surrounding countries may fall to the Libyans too. If this happens, the strife in the petroleum rich area could spark another World War.\n\nAs part of Operation Removal, you'll spearhead the U.S. response to the recent Libyan invasion. We've re-equipped and reactivated the 3rd Armored Division to help you battle the threat and you're the new platoon leader.\n\nYou must not only destroy the Libyan threat, but drive them out of Tunisia. Unfortunately, it won't be easy. Due to recent financial problems in the Former Soviet Union, the Libyans and Tunisian rebels are well armed with T-72's and other Soviet made weapons that were sold off as surplus. Finally, we don't have any time to enlist help from our allies, so you'll be on your own. In fact, our intelligence tells us that they could take the capital in as little as four days. So saddle up and get ready to ride, you've got a war to prevent."
