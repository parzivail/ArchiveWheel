	  "Shadow Watch is the exciting new strategy game from Red Storm Entertainment. Featuring stunning artwork and a typically engaging storyline, Shadow Watch sees you the player leading a crack team of agents who fight crime in various cities around the world. This 'Corporation' is trying to aid a group of scientists who want to build a space station, it's up to you and your crew to do whatever necessary to make this happen.\n\nThis demo version of Shadow Watch allows you to testdrive either the game's campaign mode, or the four exclusive demo missions. The campaign demo is a short mission in which the player is auditioning for the role as Chief of Security for the Corg International Corporation. The player must reslove various hostile situations to prove to the corporation that they are worthy of the job. The other missions included are designed to test your ability in different situations. In the demo you are able to choose two of the six characters that will be included in the full version."
