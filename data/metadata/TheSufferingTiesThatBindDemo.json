	"description": [
	  "Delve into a disturbed psyche, in a gruesome struggle for redemption.\n\nSet in the slums and prisons of Baltimore, take control of Torque as he seeks revenge against the mysterious Caleb Blackmore, a man somehow tied to the death of Torque's family. Explore the tough and unforgiving inner-city streets, where poverty and urban injustices trap people just as effectively as a physical prison.\n\nThe Suffering: Ties That Bind is an action-horror game that emphasises the disturbing terror of its predecessor, with all-new twisted creatures and a few familiar faces. The unique morality system returns, as players delve into the perverse world of Torque's sanity to discover his past and struggle to control his future."
