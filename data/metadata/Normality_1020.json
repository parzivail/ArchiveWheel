	  "\"As Kent, a shameless dreamer, you must explore the vast city of Neutropolis through true 3D movement and solve the riddle of a nations apathy. Point and click with unique voodoo doll interface and be rewarded by absurdly convincing motion capture sequences as you gather clues and solve puzzles. Chuckle at the bizarre plot and chew carpet while your brain wraps itself around puzzles that are greater than the sum of their parts. If you manage to understand the mystery that shrouds Neutropolis, you're only halfway there...\n<p>\nA little story... A sinister force now controls the city of Neutropolis. a once thriving city, full of beauty and light, reduced to a stagnant pit of grotesque, steaming, almost monstrous apathy.\n<\/p><p>\nAwkward?... As Kent, one of Neutropolis' most awkward citizens, you have been imprisoned for a week and are now under home arrest for that most sinister of crimes... whistling in public.\n<\/p><p>\nRats?... A rat in a washing machine, beans on the wall and a rebellious underground movement awaits you. Norm troopers subdue the population under the control of Paul, the city's leader, whose twin brother mysteriously died 30 years ago.\n\nBrian?... Why is the city so controlled? Why does the most successful company in town make furniture? Why can't penguins fly? Who is Brian Deluge? How can you solve the riddle of the mystery of the clue of the puzzle that shrouds Neutropolis?\"<\/p>"
