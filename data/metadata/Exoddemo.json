	  "<div>When last we saw Abe, he'd just rescued ninety-nine Mudokons from RuptureFarms and struck a serious blow to the Glukkons of the rapacious Magog Cartel. Once an ignorant, happy floor-waxer, Abe now found himself a hero to his people. You might think Abe had earned a vacation... ...but that was before he fell on his head and had a vision. Three restless ghosts let Abe in on a shocking secret...\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Rupture Farms was just one of many slaughterhouses the Glukkons are using to exploit the Mudolons. Even worse is the SoulStorm Brewery, where super-addictive SoulStorm Brew is made from the bones of dead Mudokons mined from Necrum, the ancient Mudokon city of the dead.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Abe being a schmuck--uh, hero--set out across the desert with five friends to find Necrum. When the game opens, Abe and his pals have snuck into the Necrum Mines.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Your mission is to destroy the Mines by sabotaging the boilers that power the place. You'll have to find your five friends, too...but keep them away from SoulStorm Brew. One slug of that stuff and they'll get sick, be no use to anyone...unless you can find a way to heal them. And how do you do that? I bet those three restless ghost might have an idea. They're probably hanging around their tomb. If you find the ghosts, maybe you can get them to confirm the rumor that Scrabs and Paramites are running free in the Vaults of necrum.\u00a0<\/div>"
