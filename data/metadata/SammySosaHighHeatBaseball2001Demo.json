	"description": [
	  "3DO's critically acclaimed High Heat Baseball franchise has a new star. The Roberto Clemente Man of the Year award winner for 1999, Sammy Sosa, lends his name to the newest installment of the popular baseball series. This edition boasts an advanced 3-D game engine and several new features. Sosa is among the 750 Major League Baseball players (from the 1999 and 2000 rosters) appearing in this game, which lets you create your own baseball league. This customization feature allows you to define the number of teams, length of schedule, playoff length, and other factors. In the career\/season mode, you can make multiplayer trades based on numerous variables.\n\nEach baseball player is animated using TruPlay artificial intelligence technology, which captures realistic base running, fielding, and hitting. The game also features a new \"smart\" camera that captures the onscreen action as if it were being broadcast on your TV set. Remote control, couch, and pizza not included."
