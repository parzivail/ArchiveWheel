	"description": [
	  "Myst V: End of Ages is the last chapter in the Myst story. Developed by Cyan Worlds and published by Ubisoft in 2005, End of Ages is set just a few years after the events of Uru, To D'ni, and The Path of the Shell.\n\nIn End of Ages, the same player from Uru has finally returned to K'veer, the room in D'ni occupied by Atrus in both Myst and Riven. The Myst Linking Book is here; however it is locked, and Atrus is long gone.\n\nAs the player explores, he or she meets up with Yeesha, who seems older somehow, and discouraged. The player realizes that what was set in motion with the release of the Bahro in Uru was only the start of what Yeesha requires of the player to help restore D'ni to its former grandeur.\n\nA Tablet of Power is locked by Slates, which the player must gather through four breathtaking Ages. Along the way, the player meets Esher, one of the few remaining full-blooded D'ni, who narrates the histories of the Ages as well as his own views of Yeesha, the Bahro, and the player's destiny with the future of D'ni. The decisions that the player makes in The End of Ages determine whether or not the stories of Yeesha, D'ni, and the Bahro will have a happy end.. or not."
