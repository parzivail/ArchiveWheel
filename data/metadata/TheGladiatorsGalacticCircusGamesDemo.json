	"description": [
	  "A ground breaking multi-player concept, The Gladiators has taken out the drawbacks of the RTS genre to provide an intense non-stop action gameplay. Thanks to the fast forward gameplay emphasizing tactical choices over fastidious resource management and base construction, games last less than 20 minutes.\n\nTwo modes are set: deathmatch in which all players are on their own and team play in which two teams will fight for the round.\n\nA powerful home-brewed engine for limitless gaming experience. Raw display power: more than 5 million polygons\/second. Special zoom. Infinite vision distance courtesy of a system enabling real time, detail level change.\n\nThe terrain and 3D objects (units, vegetation and structures) are displayed with more than four texture levels each. Each object can be used and destroyed by the player. The arena is modeled entirely in 3D and the spectators voice their approval or dissatisfaction during bouts. Units can climb on structure and hide behind them.\n\nSearch for the optimum route: taking topographic data into account. Each unit's line of vision is managed in real time using a ray trace system. Each unit has its own psychological profile: individual combat behavior. Several ballistic calculation systems corresponding to the different weapons.\n\nSelf-adjustment of the engine according to players' configurations and the power of their PCs. There is a progression on a scale of one to ten from the simplest to the most challenging versions of the game.\n\n3 civilizations : Human\/Fantasy\/Galactic. 24 different units and up to 500 units at the same time. Up to 16 players over LAN and Internet. Around 15 Maps exclusively created for Multiplayer Mode. A fully interactive environment: use and destroy the scenery, vegetation and buildings. A Real Time Strategy non-stop Action oriented GAME Constant action multi-player concept"
