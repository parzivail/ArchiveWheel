	  "After months of preparation and planning, you have the whole of Europe at your feet, ripe for the taking. You have demilitarized the allies of human and computer opponents alike, and through shrewd skill and strategy, you have turned their neighbours against them.\n\nVictory is at hand, and it is up to you to claim it. Now is the time for you to rise to the occasion and use your negotiating skills to establish your ultimate control over a continent.\n\nYou have played nations against one another, tailored your responses accordingly, and watched their reaction with caution: all that remains is for you to finish them."
