	  "One hot night in Palermo, Italy, a terrible fight broke out in one of the streets of the old town. The sound of gunfire, screams, and yelling filled the night air; the next morning Chico Mangano was found, shot dead, on the pavement. A gun was located close to the scene and with the evidence of two eyewitnesses; the conclusion was that three of Chico\u00e2s brothers, Romano, Angelo, and Sonny were responsible for the murder; Police began an intensive manhunt to find the three brothers but failed. They had vanished. Two years passed on the small Mediterranean island and one day Grandpa Mangano received a phone call from far away.The call was from his eldest son, Vincenzo Mangano, who had left Sicily decades ago. Vincenzo said that the three brothers had been seen alive and well in the same city that Vincenzo lived. Grandpa Mangano dispatched his fifth grandson to start working for Vincenzo, and then, when he was strong and powerful, to hunt down and kill the three murderous brothers. He sent him to America, to Paradise City. \n\nGangland is very unique game that combines many different genres. The mix of such a divergent themes works surprisingly well and give the player a vast selection of options when trying to outplay the opposing families. In addition, the developers did an excellent job in creating a gangster movie-like atmosphere with corrupted cops, ruthless mobsters, and deceiving women. This is a game where crime pays - and it pays a lot."
