	  "You are cast as the lone protector, and your Type 16 transport has the capability of morphing between a weapon-packed fighter craft and a heavily armored assault tank. Using the Type 16, you scorch your path across unnervingly realistic 3D terrains. You have a task, a goal, and a motivation. You're here to evacuate the colony and to save lives. You'll defend your charges with strategy and cunning, and when necessary (believe me, it's always necessary), you'll stage preemptive strikes, enter vicious dogfights, light up the skies with pyrotechnic carnage, and blast paths through charging ground forces. The foe is evil, merciless, insidious, immovable, and spectacular in its strength. You have your wit, your nerve, your experience, and above all the immutable knowledge that only you can save the colonists."
