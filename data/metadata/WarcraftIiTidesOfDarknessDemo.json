	  "With the death of the Orcish Warchief Blackhand, his underling Orgrim Doomhammer was quick to seize control over the most powerful of the Orcish forces on Azeroth. Although each day finds other factions growing stronger within the chaotic Horde, it seems certain that all of the clans will follow Orgrim's plans to hunt down and destroy the renegade Azerothiens wherever they choose to run\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 Sir Lothar, in charge of the scattered armies of Azeroth since the death of King Llane, has led his people across the Great Sea to the shores of Lordaeron. By enlisting the armies of Lordaeron, and making new allies in the Elves and Dwarves, a mighty force known as the Alliance has been forged. Now, the last of the once great armies of Azeroth seek retribution for the loss of their homeland. Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness takes the continuing saga of Azeroth to the next level as the battle rages on over land, sea, and air. Using new weapons of war, including Dragons, Battleships, Elven Archers, Zepplins, Death Knights and Juggernauts, both Humans and Orcs must use combined-arms tactics in an effort to become the true rulers of Azeroth. The game also includes a new strategic \u00e2fog of war\u00e2 feature which allows players to only see activity within their units' line of sight. Players are not able to see their enemy's movement outside the fog of war, but they can see the terrain of explored areas. This adds a whole new level of strategy as scouting and sentries become vital to defending your territory. With maps four times larger than the original Warcraft, up to eight player network support, SVGA graphics, an improved interface, and an included Windows 95 map, unit, and sound editor, Warcraft II has become a smash hit. It's sold over 500,000 copies worldwide, and has been translated into French, German, and Italian. Recently available is the expansion set, Beyond the Dark Portal, which adds two new campaigns and even tougher missions."
