	  "\"Many decades ago, mankind conquered the stars. With the development of advanced space craft, new worlds and intelligent lifeforms were discovered within and beyond the Solar system. However, space travel was restricted to military personnel and scientists despite its conveniences.\n\nIn 2035AD, they decided to unify all lifeforms in outer space, but an interplanetary war started in 2041AD, with Earth involved.\n\nIn 2044AD, Galactic Command (GALCOM) was formed to maintain law and order amongst planets. The Gammulan race opposed the alliance and war was waged between GALCOM and Gammulans.\n\nIn 3000AD, player was recruited to defend the GALCOM consortium of planets against Gammulans. At 02:34:22 intergalactic time, A GALCOM diplomatic craft developed a navigational malfunction and strayed into Gammulan territory. GALCOM supreme commander Stranix reported a Sphinx class battlecruiser was intentionally destroyed by Gammulan orbital defence system, with no survivors. Meanwhile, a team of Renegade class interceptors ambushed a Gammulan starfighter in GALCOM sector 04:66-B.\n\nBattlecruiser 3000AD (also known as [BC3K] in Usenet) is one of the longest-developed games in computer game history. It was under development for seven years, and was still extremely bug ridden when eventually released. \""
