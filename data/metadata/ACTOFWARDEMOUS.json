	  "Ripped from today's headlines Act of War is a frightening and believable tale of suspense, international intrigue and geopolitical military conflict. Through a techno-thriller story constructed by best-selling author Dale Brown, this real-time strategy experience puts you squarely in control of counterterrorist forces to defend cities of the world. It's the first look at tomorrow's war. You command units of a newly formed anti-terror military unit known as the Talon Task Force. During missions, you will recruit combat units, develop technologies, manage finite resources, and deploy your forces. Cinematic sequences, intelligence reports and in-game events reported through 'real' communication channels (such as news feeds or satellite links with command officers) propel the story forward. Highly realistic modern military technology, recognizable world cities such as Washington D.C., London, and San Francisco, and a story by best-selling author Dale Brown all contribute to the authenticity of the Act of War experience. Capture enemy soldiers. Rescue hostages and civilians within cities under siege. Experience the first look at tomorrow's war. No place is safe!"
