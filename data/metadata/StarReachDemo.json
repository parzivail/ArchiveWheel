	  "\"Star Reach features split-screen action to allow two opponents to play head to head, or against computer opponents. Players can also go it alone and play against one to three computer opponents. Programmed in 32-bit protected mode, players will thrill to the real-time, simultaneous strategy with over 20 scenarios, a 4-channel digital soundtrack and digitized speech. With stereo music, 3-D rendered battle-space ships, multiple scenarios and seven alien species, multiple combinations assure that the player will never get the same game twice. For those with a preference, Star Reach supports different playing styles from all-out arcade action to pure strategy, or combinations of both.\n\nControlling a vast fleet of space craft and troops, players attempt to rule the galaxy through planetary colonization, economic decision making and space combat. With six different planet types to choose from and with different resources on each, players may capture a mineral-based planet for its mighty resources, build a domed community on a world of ice or outmaneuver and destroy ruthless enemies bent on taking over their planets. Players control all the action as they make every decision and move simultaneously with their opponents.\n\nPlayers can customize their fleets to use the types of ships that fit their playing style from light fighters, destroyers, satellites, troop-carriers, pirate ships, and many more. Players will establish colonies on conquered planets and make use of available resources. Stereo sound effects bring each and every battle to life in native sound board support for most major sound cards. \""
