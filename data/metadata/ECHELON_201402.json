	  "<div>Echelon is an action filled strategy game played in an alternative science-fiction environment.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>In the distant galaxy of Ring World the inhabitant species formed an advanced society. They set their differences and conflicts aside to live in mutual understanding, peace treaty they destroyed their weaponry developed over the long years of war. What wasn't demolished was hid in secret repositories on far-away planets of the galaxy.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Many hundred of years went by in peace. The memory of the dark ages of war faded. The planets of the Ring World became the Gardens of Eden. One day unknown spaceships showed up on the horizon. The beings on-board called themselves HUMANS. The inhabitants had to realise that the rest of the Universe did not live in peace as they had.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>After destroying their own home the Humans set out to conquer the universe. They slaved all civilisations they discovered in the Universe, settled on the planets and exhausted the natural resources. They went from planet to planet, from universe to universe: Discovered, explored and destroyed, marking each solar system with a number. Their next target was number 63.....\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>There they found the Ring World, a planet rich in minerals and inhabited by species that have not held weapons for hundreds of years. An ideal place for conquer. Humans could ravage undisturbed. The peaceful inhabitants had no chance against them. The hard-created peace and equilibrium was on the verge of downfall. On the last free planets the natives, breaking their peace vow, went in search of the legendary repositories.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Soon the Humans headquarters received distressing news from System 63. They found themselves suddenly up against weapons never seen before. The freedom fight lasted long and claimed many victims. Finally the people of the Ring World won; they rid their planets of the Humans. But this was not a true victory, with their weapons they brought to the surface the long forgotten differences and hatred. These didn't go away with the intruders, but stayed to turn them against each other.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>War returned, but this time from within, to conquer the deserted territories of this Lost Eden, the Ring World.\u00a0<\/div>"
