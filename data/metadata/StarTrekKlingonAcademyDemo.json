	  "Klingon Academy is the latest Star Trek title from Interplay, which is in fact a prequel to the forthcoming Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. As the title suggests, you are a rookie who has recently joined the Klingon Academy and, under the supervision and guidance of your mentor, General Chang, you must learn how to become a noble warrior. If and when you succeed, you will be fighting for not just yourself and Chang, but the whole Klingon Empire!\nThe Klingon Academy demo is fully playable and features two modes of play. The first is Quick Battle, which sees the player commanding the mighty Klingon Battlecruiser. This is probably the easiest mission included and is definitely recommended for new players. The other missions Incursion and A Dish Best Served Cold are for the more experienced of 'Trekkies' among us. Each of these missions asks whether or not you want to do the training mission, which is advised to let you get a feel for the controls.\n\nEach mission is delivered in glorious 3D and were exclusively designed for the demo."
