	  "<div>Your country reels under the weight of economic depression. You're part of a once-proud military heritage, but now your government can't afford your pay and you're barely able to make ends meet for your family. Your neighboring country is experiencing unprecedented prosperity. Now they've found a pocket of oil offshore and claimed it for themselves.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>When your unit is sent to seize the oil-rich territories which are rightfully yours, you are the first to lead the strike. It may be your country's last chance. You live in a country whose economy prospers and whose principles you've come to treasure. So much so that you'd lay your life on the line so that your country and her allies can continue to live in freedom.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>You never expected to be thrown into battle with your country's greatest cold war rival. You never expected to have to test your mettle against such skilled, desperate adversaries or to face the consequences of war. But you vowed to serve your country and defend her allies to the last. The battle begins. Choose your side, and determine your country's destiny.<\/div>"
