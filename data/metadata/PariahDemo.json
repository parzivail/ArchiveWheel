		"reviewbody": "This is the most forgotten, underrated title I've ever come across in gaming. I really think only a small amount of people even know it exists. It's a pretty good game though and when it still had multiplayer support, it was even better. It came out around Half Life 2, and didn't do anything really new so that's why it got trashed on in reviews. Although it didn't really need to do much new to still be an enjoyable FPS, and one that's at least better in terms of design than most modern FPS. You can probably find this game really cheap, for Xbox or PC. I recommend it for any FPS fan. ",
