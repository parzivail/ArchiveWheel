	  "The noble samurai looked down from Mt. Fujiyama and chanted his final prayers to Amaterasu, goddess of the Sun. In his trembling hands, he grasped the Daikatana, his labor of love. His quest to imbue the sword with the magic of time travel had led him to this cliff, to this ultimate sacrifice. The Daikatana lacked only his soul to become a talisman for all eternity. With the fierce eye of a warrior, the samurai thrust the sword deeply into his flesh as drops of fresh blood rained down from the holy mountain\u00e2\u00a6\n\nIn 2455A.D., in the dark, volcanic caverns of Mt. Fujiyama, a seasoned team of archaeologists searched tirelessly for the mythical Daikatana. Warned by seismologists that the great volcano would soon erupt, the crews worked against time itself to uncover the sacred, ancient sword. Deep within a network of caves, the team at last found the Daikatana\u00e2s resting-place as steam and molten rock began to seep through fissures in the walls. Celebration gave way to terror as volcanic ash began to fall like poison snow. Desperate to deliver the Daikatana and save their own lives, the archaeologists tried to escape the waking giant. Fujiyama trembled with violent earthquakes as lava poured through the caves, killing most of the unfortunate workers. The Daikatana, however, was safely removed and transported eighty miles to Tokyo, where Dr. Toshiro Ebihara and his assistant, Dr. Jarred Benedict, anxiously awaited its arrival."
