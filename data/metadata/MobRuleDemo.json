	  "Extortion has never been so much fun!\n\nWelcome to 1930's America. Organized crime is on the rise and a number of criminal Families are fighting for control of the illicit markets - booze, prostitution, gambling, you name it - it's all sprouting up like weeds through Johnny Law's clenched fist. This is a dog-eat-dog world of corruption, murder, and sex...and as the new kid on the block, you're lookin' a little like a milk bone. \n\nMob Rule marries the Underworld and strategy gaming in a uniquely addictive and hilarious package. Starting as a common street thug, the player ascends through the ranks of the Mob in 1930's America with the objective of gaining control of the Syndicate.\n\nA Mobster Sim --- Boy Scouts need not apply!\n\nYour quest for total criminal control in the full game will take you through 5 cities - from the jerk water 'burb of Hick Town to the Mecca of Organized Crime, Capitol City - and through hundreds of animated CG sequences that show the lighter side of life in the Underworld. This demo however includes the early stages of Hick Town.  But it's not all TomGunFoolery! You're quest for dominance is a block-by-block turf war against rival families and the Government. Using your rag-tag collection of Tenants, \"Undesirables,\" Thugs, Fixers, and Gangsters, you need to wrest control of building after building until - ultimately - you control all the blocks in the land. It'll be a long-haul comprised of bloody street wars with rival gangs, shakedowns by the cops, and payola up the ying yang...but if you play your cards right, you'll walk away with a cut of EVERY illegal activity in the nation!  \n\nRemember, the GodFather only helps those who help themselves!  But to give you a helping hand there is a special step-by-step tutorial to show you everything from building new businesses to whacking an opposing boss."
