	  "Welcome to Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines.  A real time tactical wargame that features intense combat spiced with formidable mission puzzles.\n\nDid you ever imagine yourself in classic war movies such as \"Where Eagle Dare\", \"Dirty Dozen\", \"Force Ten From Navarrone\", etc.  Well, now you really can venture behind enemy lines.  As commander of an elite group of Commandos in WWII, you can relive history by completing some of the most hair-raising missions of the war.  You are outgunned and outmanned, but not outclassed.\n\nEach mission starts with a briefing that outlines your goals.  There are several secondary objectives that must be completed in order to complete the overall mission.  Save often and plan your moves carefully.  There are many paths to solving your goals.  The main objective is NOT to lose any Commandos.  They are indispensable.  Each Commando has unique combat abilities that others cannot match.\n\nThe German units outnumber and out gun your boys.  If you attempt to fight them head on, you will quickly lose your team.  Instead, try to watch their patrol paths, and then take them out in a stealthy\/ambush manner.  German soldiers have realistic AI.  They can hear and see your men.  They can see footprints and dead bodies. They also have unique dispositions.  Some will merely ask you to halt, while others will execute you on sight.\n\nCommandos can operate many items\/objects \u00e2 you will see the cursor change to a hand pulling a lever when this action is possible. Your men have two main weapons: Gun and Knife.  The knife is silent and will not attract attention (just make sure Tiny or Spooky moves the body!).  The gun is quick and has a longer range.  It is best used in ambush.  However it will attract attention.  Listen carefully to your mission briefing and plot your attack."
