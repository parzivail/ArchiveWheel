	  "<div>The Splat Pack is the official add-on for Carmageddon. It adds 20 new tracks, 15 new cars, 9 new environments, new network levels and 3Dfx support. The player car also underwent small optical changes.<br \/><\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Please note that unlike the previous timed demo, the Splat Pack demo is not<\/div><div>restricted by a set 4-minute time limit. What's the point if we did? You've<\/div><div>no doubt already gone out a bought the full game already (if you haven't....<\/div><div>welcome to planet earth). Even if we did put a time on, the guys (and gals)<\/div><div>out on the net are only going to crack it within minutes anyway.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Saying that, this demo still acts like the full game. So you can still drive<\/div><div>around for as long as you like, provided that you can accumulate the time!<\/div><div>The plot. \u00a0Are you kidding? \u00a0You want a plot?? There wasn't a plot last time<\/div><div>so why should there be one now? Just drive around, hit things, run (ahem)<\/div><div>zombies over. Knock over suits of armour, fall off very tall cliffs, turn the<\/div><div>other vehicles into burning wrecks, do donuts. \u00a0Hey, have some fun.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>There are three ways of completing a race in Carmageddon:<\/div><div>1\/ \u00a0Destroy all five opponent cars by ramming them.<\/div><div>2\/ \u00a0Kill EVERY SINGLE (cough) zombie on the track - that should keep ya busy.<\/div><div>3\/ \u00a0Go through all the Checkpoints in order, thus completing a lap of the<\/div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0 track. Then repeat 6 times (yawn).<\/div><div>Feel free to ignore the rules and do whatever you want - it'll be fun anyway.<\/div><div>Don't be afraid to veer from the race course, as you never know what you may<\/div><div>find!<\/div>"
