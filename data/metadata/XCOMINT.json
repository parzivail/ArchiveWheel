	  "<div>Welcome to the demo version of X-COM: Interceptor, the latest installment in the award-winning X-COM series.<\/div><div>Those of you who are familiar with the X-COM series might be surprised to find out that there are some big changes this time around, the biggest being that X-COM has left Earth and taken to the stars to fight the alien threat. Instead of managing terrestrial bases and commanding ground troops, you - as the X-COM Commander-in-Chief - are in charge of managing star bases and hopping right into the cockpit of X-COM fighter craft, where you'll go head-to-head with the alien menace.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>This demo will give you a taste of what you can expect during your tour of duty on the Frontier. In the demo, you'll have things relatively easy. You'll be able to have a look at all the strategy screens where you'll manage your bases, perform your research and so on in the actual game \u2013 but all you'll really need to concentrate on after your screen tour in the demo is flying your interceptor in combat.<\/div>"
