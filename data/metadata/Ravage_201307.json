	  "A top secret government research program known as Project Vortex has changed the world forever. The scientists involved were dedicated visionaries attempting to break through the barriers between the dimensions. But when they reached their goal, all of Pandora's evils were unleashed upon the Earth. A race known as the Necron had also been breaching the dimensions, moving from one world to the next. The Necron take what they want and leave the smoldering remains of entire civilizations in their wake. When Project Vortex opened that first gate, the Necron detected the disturbance and followed it straight to Earth. Before long, dimensional gates started opening around the globe. Necron armies descended upon the great cities of the world. The world was ablaze and the stench of burning bodies made it seem like hell had erupted and flooded the planet. Now... most of the worlds population has been captured and \"reconditioned\" to accept the Necron as their keepers. Many who resisted suffered a worse fate \"adaptation\": they become slave hybrids. No longer human they are slave labor in dangerous environments across the Necron's dark empire. You are PFC Eugene Jenkins once a dentist in everyday society, now a soldier in the Human resistance fight against the Necron menace and also the sole survivor of Operation Black Out. You're stationed beneath the sewers of Washington DC in a project Vortex lab. Its all up to you to rid the planet of the Necron menace. Good luck."
