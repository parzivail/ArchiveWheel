	  "Pirates have taken over Rayman's world, and they have imprisoned him and most of his friends. Rayman has escaped from the pirates, but he needs to regain his powers in order to free his friends from the pirates and their boss, the evil Razorbeard. Ly the fairy is the only one who can help him, but she too has been captured by the pirates. To free her, Rayman must battle pirates and disable the machine that has placed her in suspension. The pirates have broken the primordial energy of the world into a thousand pieces, called \"lums\". Rayman needs to recover these lums in order to regain his powers. Also, the red lums contain vital energy that can restore Rayman's health."
