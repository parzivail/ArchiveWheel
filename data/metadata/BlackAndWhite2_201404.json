	  "<div>Will you be an evil or a benevolent deity? That's the choice you must make upon returning to a warring land in Black & White 2. Like its predecessor, Black & White, the sequel is all about moral choices. The land, however, has transformed itself. The inhabitants of this breathtaking 3D world have lost their innocence and developed new weapons and technology. As you enter this warring world, will you make tribes coexist peacefully; encouraging villages and towns to grow into sprawling metropolises, or prompt them to inflict their will upon others by, creating and commanding large armies that seek to dominate and conquer?<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Creatures in the game have grown too. They can learn strategies, master new abilities and skills, lead armies into battle and be your ultimate unit. Black & White 2 includes other new elements, such as improved graphics and miracle effects such as rivers of fire and earthquakes that yield massive destruction. Every choice you make will have an impact. Each action and inactions prompts obvious changes to buildings, flora and fauna, all morphing to reflect your personality.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>This demo lets you learn the intricacies of playing god as you check out one of the early lands in the game.<\/div>"
