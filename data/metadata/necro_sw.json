	  "\u00a0Necrodome is a gritty, fast paced, car-combat game taking place in enclosed arenas called Pits. The setting is the near future, in a post-apocalyptic society starved for violent entertainment. The world is now divided into almost feudal-like city-states, each having its own \"Pit,\" based on the surrounding terrain and the materials they have on hand. Pits have been built on snow fields, deserts, and lava flats, to name a few.<div><br \/><\/div><div>\u00a0The Driver will be provided with a vehicle suitable for the task at hand...a fast, armored car (called a Raider) loaded with the latest weapons and electronic systems. A Raider is equipped with a main gun and a turret weapon (which may be fired simultaneously) along with having the ability to drop mines, emit smoke screens, and the like. In addition, the Driver may leap out of his car (equipped with a shotgun) and enter areas too small for his vehicle, flip switches, grab items and ammo, or run to safe areas to obtain a new car if his old one is destroyed.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Necrodome is a Win95 application and will support single or duo-network play, with a player able to be either a driver or the gunner of a car driven by another player. This in effect allows a player to hop into the car of another driver and become his turret gunner.<\/div>"
