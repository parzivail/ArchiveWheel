	  "Wanna be a gangster in a Chicago style city of the 1920's? Wanna control an underground organization dealing in extortion, illegal liquor, prostitution, violence, intimidation, gambling, gang warfare, bribery of officials, permanent elimination of individuals and a host of moneymaking activities? Can you simultaneously maintain a decent and honest reputation on the surface by supporting good causes, helping the police and running legitimate businesses? Will you be able to meet the challenge of balancing these two personas to gain influence and control over the city? Gangsters is a highly original game that blends together three major elements of successful strategy gaming;\n\n    Real-time game world interaction\n    Man-management\n    Business management \n\nThe aim of this game is to build your gang and business empire to rule the city. To do this you will have to beat three other gangs operating in the city, and avoid arrest by the authorities. The specific win conditions balance a need to gain wealth, honor and influence. Gangsters is set in a non-specific Chicago-like city in the 1920s called 'New Temperance'. The city, in which most of the in-game activity takes place, is viewed by an isometric multi-level map contained in the main window of a Windows 95 style environment."
