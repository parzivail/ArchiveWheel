	  "Scott Griffin thought that his days of killing were over. As a former pilot in the elite Anti-Insurrection Squad, Griffin had hunted rebels for years; had been their worst enemy. But that was before someone destroyed his home and kidnapped his girlfriend. Now a conspiracy involving a company called Medtech is hunting him down. His fiancee, Maria, may have been taken for experimentation with a lethal stimulant called Adrenix. And the rebel forces he once hunted to kill are now his only hope in finding Maria and saving his own life. Adrenix is jam-packed with features, including a 3D environment that runs in standard 640-by-480-pixel resolution without 3D acceleration, and a hefty count of missions for hours of lethal gameplay."
