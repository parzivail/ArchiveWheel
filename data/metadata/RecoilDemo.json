	  "Tanks patrol desolate city streets. Turrets and missile sites threaten the skies. Robot warriors carrying Pulse Rifles surround military installations. It\u00e2s war out there, and the mainframe Network has taken over.\nNo one knows for sure how it happened-the natural evolution of machines that can think for themselves? a government experiment gone awry? alien intervention? But, the fact is that machines have turned on humans. The greater human population is now a drone collective of computer-mesmerized zombies.\n\nA few outsiders have escaped the spell of the Network. They've formed an underground resistance; operating out of abandoned buildings and traveling at night to avoid detection by the machines. They have survived for some time, but they cannot defeat the Network by themselves. This alliance of dissidents needs help from an outsider. With some creative hacking, three of the dissidents have developed a computer program that gives them remote control over an experimental enemy tank. These rebels have also discovered a way to send the control program through a time loop to the recent past-the late 20th Century.\n\nThe Video Mail message crackles through pirate channels and hits your computer with an electronic charge. The dissidents have found you. They need you to use their hacked-out program to drive a killing machine through their war-torn world and liberate the people from computer control. When you engage the program, you take command over the Battle Force Tank (BFT), a fast, powerful and versatile war machine. The time loop allows for you to bypass viruses and other Network computer defenses, giving you direct and complete control.\nThe future is in your hands."
