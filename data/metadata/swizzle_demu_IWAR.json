	  "<div>For over a hundred years war has raged across the depths of space. People have always fought across new frontiers and as man colonized the galaxy nothing was different, conflict was inevitable. I-War drops the player into the middle of this conflict giving them full control over a 150 meter long Dreadnaught class corvette - the destiny of mankind lies with their actions.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Quite simply I-War (PC CD-ROM) is the most advanced and technically accomplished space sim ever created. Although I-War fits the mold of the classic space-sim there\u2019s much more to it. The game demands logical puzzle solving, imagination, flair, bravery and cunning as well as mean dog fighting skills. I-War allows the player to take any of four roles, switching at any time during a game. As captain, the player will take the ship into battle against enemy fleets in hostile skies. As pilot, the player will weave through oncoming fire - taking the ship right into the heart of the action. As gunner, the player will launch missiles against multiple targets and fire upon enemy ships - and finally as Engineer, the player will have to sort out the damage done to the ship.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>I-War is uncompromisingly realistic, using real physical models to create the gaming universe ensures complete immersion in the gaming environment. The plot develops via stunning fmv sequences, as would be expected in a space sim. What you wouldn\u2019t expect is the dramatic quality of these scenes and the seamless way in which they propel the gameplay forward. But it isn\u2019t just the plot and cut scenes in I-War that give it it\u2019s awe-inspiring looks. The in-game graphics are simply astounding with real time action that is truly\u00a0<\/div><div>cinematic.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Individually, the team behind I-War are responsible for creating some of the most cutting edge interactive entertainment ever. Now they have got together to form Sheffield based, Particle Systems and they have produced yet another benchmark product in the shape of I-War.<\/div>"
