	  "\"Climb into the cockpit of America\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s most advanced helicopter: the AH-64 Apache GUNSHIP. Race low and deadly over the treetops at 200 m.p.h.. Then lock onto your target with Hellfire missiles and 30mm cannon as you deliver a powerful punch against the enemy! They\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2ll retaliate with massive armored force but it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s up to you and GUNSHIP to extinguish their threats and survive!\n\nGUNSHIP is another in the excellent line of real-life simulations from MicroProse. As part of the brave airborne cavalry of today\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s modern Army, you, the pilot, will experience all the action, excitement, daring and suspense of attack helicopter combat under the most challenging conditions!\n\n---\n\nStrap into your ejection seat and get ready for challenging and exciting modern jet fighter combat with F-15 STRIKE EAGLE! Fly combat missions, engage enemy aircraft, and destroy enemy ground targets in the skys of Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. All the sophisticated tools of modern electronic air warfare are available including computer assisted targeting, Heads Up Display (HUD), airborne radar, and ground tracking target display maps. As the F-15 pilot, you employ your air to air missiles, cannon, and high explosive bombs to accomplish air defense and strategic deep interdiction bombing missions. The F-15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s defenses include surface to air missile launch indicators, electronic counter measures (ECM), afterburners, flares, and full aerobatic capabilities to outfight, outfly, or outthink enemy aircraft, air to air missiles, and surface to air missiles! Seven different combat missions, four skill levels, and Infinite number of combat scenarios offer continuous stimulation and excitement! F-15 will thrill and challenge you and give you the chance to prove you have the \"\"Right Stuff\"\" of an EAGLE fighter pilot! \n\n---\n\nAn Adventure So Real It Took MicroProse To create!\n\nGrab your cutless and take the helm of a 17th Century sailing ship in PIRATES!. This dramatic Caribbean adventure is a unique blend of simulation and role-playing. The game recreates the politics, economics, maritime technology and excitement of the free-wheeling era of the buccaneer.\n\nNavigate reef-strewn waters, fire cannonades in ship-to-ship battles and duel enemy captains in your pursuit of fame and fortune. Lead an overland attack. Search for buried treasure or rescue a kidnapped relative. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s all in PIRATES! and historically and geographically, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s very accurate.\n\n---\n\nThrill to the initial sighting of the enemy's strike force in your periscope as their ships come into your range. But watch out - the enemy's escorts have just sighted you. You're the hunter - but suddenly - you've become the hunted!\n\nAs Commander, you must sink their ships and keep your submarine from being destroyed - if you can. Will you select a quiet patrol sector in the Marianas Islands or choose the dangerous waters off the coast of Japan? Is a submerged daylight periscope attack best or do you charge in on the surface at night using only radar bearings to guide you? Do you fire a spread of your precious torpedoes or can you close the range and pick off the enemy with a single torpedoe shot? These decisions and many more are yours to make as you take your place among the elite ranks of the SILENT SERVICE!\n\nIt's exciting - and it's fun. It's another great Micro Prose simulation - and it's called SILENT SERVICE. Look for it now on your dealer's shelves. \""
