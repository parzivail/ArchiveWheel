	"description": [
	  "Enter the colorful, cloak and dagger world of villains and superspies, circa 1967. As The Operative, Cate Archer, you must rely on cunning, stealth, superior firepower and ingenious gadgetry to protect humanity from twisted madmen bent upon world domination. Expect to enjoy the following in the retail version of the game: \n\n15 covert missions spanning over 60 levels worthy of any super spy - skydive from a plummeting airliner, fight off killer sharks and explore twisted jungles. \n\nSmart enemies move and react with striking realism. Watch them seek cover, respond to suspicious sounds or launch a coordinated offense. \n\nRide motorcycles and snowmobiles through vast realistic landscapes and environments rich with texture and detail. \n\nMultiplay for up to 16 players. Take your chances in an all-or-nothing, Good vs. Evil multiplayer game or go head-to-head in Deathmatch mode."

	  "Welcome! Thank you for installing the No One Lives Forever Technology demo. The demo includes sample levels from three different missions plus the first training level from the retail version of the game. In order to keep the size of the demo as low as possible, we are not able to include the full variety of voices, music and sounds which will be included in the full game."
