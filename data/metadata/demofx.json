	  "<div>S.C.A.R.S. is a racing simulation for those gamers out there who aren't content with normal racing sims because they offer nothing to blow up. Conversely, it's also for gamers who wish those shoot-'em-up games put them in a nifty vehicle speeding over a great all-terrain course. This game gives you all kinds of weapons to pick up along the way, which you can use to mess up the other racers, and you can toggle between them for maximum firepower. The game runs on a real-time 3D engine that requires a 3D accelerator card to be installed, and it uses 24-bit true-color lighting to enhance the look and feel. S.C.A.R.S. works well with the Microsoft Gamepad controller, but you can play with the keyboard as well.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>This version includes a new icy track and a vicious new car.<\/div>"
