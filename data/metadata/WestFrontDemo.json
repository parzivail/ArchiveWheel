	  "The roar of the German war machine can once again be heard across the land!\n\nThe Allies scramble to prevent the conquest of Europe, to once and for all defeat Hitler and his armored menace.\n\nThe Axis coldly maneuvers to have the world bow before them.\n\nIt's all there for you to command from the start of the war in 1940 to the defeat of Berlin in 1945.\nTalonSoft's WEST FRONT places you right in the middle of World War II. This fast paced platoon-level game of tactical combat in Europe starts you out as a battalion commander and - if you have earned it - a promotion to higher ranks as the war goes on.\n\nIn addition to the Campaign Game format, you can play one of a large number of scenarios preset by an All-Star design team or allow the computer to create a random battle for you.\n\nFull feature scenario, organization and map editors also allow you to create your own battles from a database of hundreds of different platoon types, and make you the game designer!"
