	  "Welcome to Guitar Master Demo, a demonstration of Spartan Software Systems Music Series product, Guitar Master. Guitar Master is an IBM PC, XT, AT and PS\/2 compatible software program that combines the powerful features of a sequencer with the flexibility of MIDI to create a comprehensive guitar exploration and learning environment. Guitar Master is to the guitarist what the word processor has been to the writer. Guitar Master teaches you how to play any standard MIDI file format song with simplicity using a computerized, graphical fretboard. Guitar Master visually shows you where to play every note in the song, stepping forward and backward through complex leads and chords. In addition, Guitar Master can calculate, display and print hundreds of different scale and chord charts. You can create custom scale and chord charts using the edit option, easily turning notes on and off and adding custom fingerings. Custom charts can be saved as image files and later recalled. Guitar Master handles any type of alternate tuning you might want to use as well as providing support for four fretboard notations ranging from simple dots to the actual note value. With a Roland MPU-401 attachment, Guitar Master becomes a 64 track sequencer capable of recording, playing or overdubbing to any track. Since Guitar Master supports Standard MIDI Files, you can share songs with other music program that also support this standard. Guitar Master's intuitive user interface coupled with mouse support and context sensitive help screens make it an incredibly easy program to use. Guitar Master also provides an extensive \u00e2profile\u00e2 feature which allows you to customize many aspects of the program. From teaching to composing your own songs, Guitar Master has the power and flexibility you need to get the job done! Guitar Master Demo is intended to provide you with an excellent idea of the full capabilities of the actual Guitar Master product before you buy. This demonstration program provides all the function found in Guitar Master with the following exceptions. Guitar Master Demo can only display scale and chord charts in the key of C Major. Guitar Master Demo can only play the MIDI File provided on the program diskette (GMDEMO.MFF). Recorded sequences and image files cannot be saved to disk. Other than these exceptions, Guitar Master Demo functions exactly like the actual product."
