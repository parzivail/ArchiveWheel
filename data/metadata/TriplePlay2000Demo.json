	  "EA continues its Triple Play Baseball series with Triple Play 2000, which features more-responsive hitting with an increased contact zone and three vertical levels of batting animation that give you the control to hit for placement or power. TP2K also has new dramatic animations and cinematic action cameras that follow a home run into the sky and out of the park, returning the camera to the park just in time to see the heroic slugger crossing home plate, which is great--when you're not the pitcher. Triple Play 2000 has a number of other features as well, such as facial animations, more realistic running of bases and overrunning of home plate and first base, and a smarter AI that not only responds to your trade suggestions but takes the initiative to make some offers as well. This demo allows you to play three single-player innings, as the National League all-stars take on the American League all-stars at Fenway Park."
