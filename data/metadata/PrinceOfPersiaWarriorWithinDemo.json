		"reviewbody": "Prince Of Persia Warrior Within is probably my favorite game in the whole series. From the Apple 2 original, all the way up the The Forgotten Sands. It ditches the full on fantasy theme of The Sand Of Time and brings in a new, darker theme that just makes the game badass, especially the music. And I was surprised to find out the demo is a different in many aspects compared to the final build. From some of the models, Voice actors, sound effects, cinematics, traps and puzzles, and the water fountains look completely different. As well as the health bar being blue. I like that though, I like the feeling of discovering cut content from a game. It just makes it seem even more mysterious. ",
