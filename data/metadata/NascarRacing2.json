	  "\"Authentic racing from qualification to championship.\n\nAs you round turn four and enter the tri-oval at Talladega you're pushing 200 MPH and it;s 150 degrees inside your car. Behind you, Terry Labonte is inching closer and at this rate he'll take the air off your spoiler. As you speed through turn one you hear your spotter on the two-way\"\" \"\"Trouble in turn two. Stay low.\"\" Staying clear of the apron, you maneuver behind Dale Earnhardt in the #3 car and draft him for one more lap until you can slingshot past him in turn three leaving both Labonte and Earnhardt in the dust. This is racing as real as it gets.\n\nNEW FEATURES: -1996 season cars, drivers and tracks provide up-to-the-minute realism. -Crew chief and spotter audio alert you to track conditions. -New fast and easy Arcade Mode lets you jump in and start driving. -New mouse-driven interface makes it easy to get into the race. -Network play allows up to 8 friends to race over an IPX network. -Includes 16 tracks. -Faster frame rate and beautifully detailed SVGA graphics.\n\nRace in authentic NASCAR events on 16 different tracks: -Atlanta Motor Speedway -Bristol Motor Speedway -Martinsville Speedway -New Hampshire International Speedway -North Wilkesboro Speedway -Pocono Raceway -Richmond International Raceway -Sears Point Raceway -North Carolina Motor Speedway -Phoenix International Raceway -Charlotte Motor Speedway -Darlington Raceway -Talladega Superspeedway -Watkins Glen International -Michigan International Speedway -Dover Downs International Speedway \""
