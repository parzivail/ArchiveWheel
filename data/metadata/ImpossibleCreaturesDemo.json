	  "A real-time strategy game of combat and discovery, where imagination and experimentation are your biggest allies in a struggle against evil.\n\nThe year is 1937 and you are Rex Chance, renowned world adventurer and war correspondent. You have spent your life exploring the wilds of Africa, the ice shelves of Antarctica, and the sultry jungles of the Amazon. You\u00e2ve seen every beast on earth\u00e2\u00a6 or so you thought. You\u00e2ve just received word from your long lost father, scientist Dr. Eric Chanikov, who disappeared many years before. Suddenly, he now begs to see you. So you fly to the Isla Variatas in the South Pacific where he works in the employ of wealthy industrialist Upton Julius. But what begins as an innocent reunion quickly turns sour as you come face-to-face with the Sigma Technology.\n\nWhat is the Sigma Technology? Imagine possessing the ability to combine any two animals into a single creature. Flying elephants, giant ants, amphibious sharks...anything you can conceive. The possibilities boggle the mind! What benefits might it bring? What evil might be wrought?"
