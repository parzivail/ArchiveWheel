	  "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six is a classic Clancy-style story where you lead an elite multinational task force battling international terrorism in highly realistic settings. Game play is organized around a series of missions in which you must plan and execute precise assaults on terrorist installations. As your mission advances, you will uncover a larger and more sinister conspiracy, where the fate of the world hangs in the balance. And unlike other games, if you make a mistake, you're gone - because in the real world, one shot counts.\n\nTo carry out a mission, the player plays \"Six,\" the leader of the team, and must assemble a crack team from a pool of skilled specialists and plan the operation using an overhead three-dimensional model of the target area. Once satisfied with their strategy, the player then leads the assault using a first- or third-person (you can toggle between the two) three-dimensional view. The game will be playable by single players with artificial intelligence controlling friendly and enemy troops, or by multiple players across the internet in both collaborative and head-to-head modes.\n\nEach mission consists of two distinct phases: the planning phase and the action phase. In the planning phase, the player receives a briefing and is given all available intelligence regarding the missions. The player then selects appropriate team members, equips them, and plans the mission.\n\nRainbow Six creates the best of both strategy and action game play. The action play is team oriented - perfect for Internet play. With 20 playable characters and 17 different missions in real world locations, the variety of gameplay is extensive.\n\nSo carefully select your team and even more carefully, conceive your plan. Because it's time to go save the world. One mission at a time."
