	"description": [
	  "SWAT 3 is a first-person tactical police simulation where players assume the role of LAPD SWAT element leader. You command a five-man team throughout the chaos of hostage rescues, high-risk warrants, barricaded suspects and dignitary protection. \n\nVenture into the depths of Los Angeles in pursuit of dangerous AI-driven suspects who range from international terrorists to disgruntled citizens. More than 150 dynamic motion-captured characters react to your every move. \n\nSWAT 3's 16 missions can be played in mission mode or career mode. In mission mode the player can choose to play any mission in any order, with each mission being treated as a stand-alone experience. In career mode the story unfolds based on the outcomes of each mission. Were you able to arrest or neutralize the suspects? Was the hostage rescued? \n\nThere isn't just one correct path to successfully complete each mission. Systematically search an environment, or breach and clear to target \u00e2 an arsenal of authentic equipment and tactics are at your command. \n\nDeveloped in conjunction with active LAPD SWAT officers and former LAPD police Chief Daryl F. Gates, SWAT 3's combination of tactics and action-packed intensity creates a game unlike any other on the market."
