	  "Space Bunnies Must Die ! is a ten level action game that pits you against an army of mutant bunnies from another galaxy. The bunny complex, which you must infiltrate, is set up as a slaughterhouse and slave labor camp where these alien invaders murder, oppress and experiment upon human and animal captives. The complex is divided into ten levels, each designed to exploit and torture people. The demo you are about to play is one of these levels. It is called The Extermination Level because it is where humans, who are viewed as worthless vermin by the Bunnies, are sent to be, well, disposed of...\n\nAll Bunnies are hostile, so kill 'em any way you can. However, not all creatures mean you harm. There are those who may help you if you are clever enough to turn them away...from the dark side.\n\nYou play Allison Huxter, a truck-stop waitress who must battle the evil horde of Bunnies in order to rescue your kidnapped sister. There are several things you must do in order to rescue her. Each of the game's levels contains a jewel encrusted carrot-scepter which is guarded by the level boss. You need all of the scepters in order to unlock Lotar's Level and find your sister. Your goal in this demo level is to find and secure its scepter.\n\nOnce inside a level, you are trapped there until you can power up the Transporter which will beam you out. The Transporters run on special radioactive carrots which grow only in this volcano, and each requires ten carrots to operate.\n\nFind all ten carrots and the scepter, and you've cleared the level."
