	  "You are John Mullins, a professional consultant with a long combat record and a reputation for getting the job done when the world\u00e2s governments can\u00e2t. After a long and distinguished career in the Army\u00e2s Special Forces, you\u00e2re now in business for yourself, taking most of your contracts from a secret organization known only as The Shop. Together with your old friend Sam Gladstone and your partner, Madeline Taylor, you combat terrorism around the globe.\n\nYou\u00e2ve learned that a bloodthirsty worldwide terrorist organization has developed a deadly genetic virus and is threatening to unleash it on the world unless their demands are met. Your mission: root out the terrorist organization, uncover their secret plans, put a stop to their operation and bring their leader to justice.\n\nFailure is not an option."
