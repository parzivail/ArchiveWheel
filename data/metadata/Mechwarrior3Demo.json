	  "The Inner Sphere's long awaited counter-attack against the vicious Smoke Clan Jaguar rages on, but the enemy isn't willing to lay down and die. On a world with the ironic name of \"Tranquil\", one of the last ranking Smoke Jaguar Star Colonels is preparing a bastion for his Clan to lick its wounds and prepare its vengeance. Your mission- conduct a high-impact commando raid on Tranquil and destroy its usefulness as a base of operations before the enemy has a chance to dig in. The tricky part is, MechWarrior, that the Jaguars know they're beaten and, honorable or not, they're going to try everything to see that they get their shot at vengeance against the Inner Sphere. You can bet they're going to start with the closest target-- you."
