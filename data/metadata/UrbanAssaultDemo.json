	  "Urban Assault is a game quite different from any you have played before. It is a sci-fi action game at its core that also incorporates real-time strategy gameplay in a unique atmospheric setting. Urban Assault is well suited for gamers who appreciate intense, unrelenting, eyes-out-of-their-sockets 3-D vehicle action as well as field strategy and tactics.\n\nTo be successful, you must be good at 2 things:  You must constantly juggle being able to command strategically on a high level, while being tenacious in controlling individual vehicles first hand.  You will not win on more advance levels if you just hang back and use the Host Station Map only! Jump into your vehicles and take control!\n\nThe basic goal is to eliminate each region's occupying enemy force (there are 5 separate enemy factions total spanning 41 single player levels in the full retail version)"
