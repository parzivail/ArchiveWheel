	  "Hacknoid is based on the traditional games where you control a paddle, and try to bounce the ball to break bricks on the screen. \u00a0The Hacknoid difference lies primarily in its award-winning 3D playfield design!<div><br \/><\/div><div><div>The goal of Hacknoid is simple - to complete all the levels of the game. \u00a0In order to complete each level, you need to destroy all the bricks on that level. \u00a0The bricks are the \"blocks\" which appear in two levels - one just above the midpoint of the screen, and the other on the top of the screen.\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>In order to destroy the bricks, you primarily use your ball. \u00a0You start the game initially with 5 balls (possibly less if you have continued the game), and use them one at a time. \u00a0To make the ball appear on the paddle, press the left mouse button. \u00a0Press the button again the release the ball and begin that level (the ball will eventually leave your paddle on its own if you wait too long). \u00a0The ball will bounce off the bricks above you, breaking them in the process. \u00a0It also bounces off the ceiling and the four walls of the playing field. \u00a0When it comes back to the bottom, move your paddle underneath it to bounce the ball back up again. \u00a0If you don't contact the ball with your paddle, it will be lost, and you need to start with another ball.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Although the paddle appears flat, it actually has a rounded shape, and therefore can rebound the ball in different directions depending on where it hits the paddle. \u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Bricks also get older and decay as you play a level. \u00a0If you take too long, the bricks will fall away on their own. \u00a0You get no points or credit for those bricks, so it is better to try to break them all yourself. \u00a0Some top-level bricks, when they are broken, will release bonus items. \u00a0Pick these items up to get extra power or points. \u00a0But watch out - there are some one that you won't want to pick up!\u00a0<\/div><\/div>"
