	  "<div>Escape ODT (Escape or Die Trying) is a third-person-perspective 3D action adventure in which an epidemic is consuming the city Calli. You are on your way to deliver the cure (a magical green pearl) to Calli, when your ship is pulled down by a strange force on top of a tower in the Forbidden Zone. You are appointed by the captain to explore the tower and find fuel for the craft, setting out in unfamiliar territory. The tower to be explored has eight levels, each consisting of many sectors. Each level of the tower has its own environment and dangers. Gameplay is a combination of action, exploration, and puzzle-solving, with high-intensity action through hand-to-hand combat, weapons, and magic spells. You can choose one of four different characters to play in the game, each with special abilities.<\/div>"
